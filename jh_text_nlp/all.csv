Lets laugh, play, and make memories. However I don't date by texting and emaling. I have had a TX, real estate broker's license for the last 35 years, and have bought sold and flipped a few houses in addition to selling for years. I am classy, yet casual. I love people. I have a very youthful attitude, and enjoy skiing, fishing, theatre, ATV riding, boating, and traveling. I love music, dancing, and the sound of ocean waves. I like fireplaces, lightening storms, waterfalls and fireworks. I have done a lot of fundraising and charity work, and feel the need to pay it forward. I'm a good cook and like to entertain. I have a great sense of humor, and love to laugh and play. I don't want to be around negative people. I refuse to grow old, and don't enjoy people who take life too seriously. I enjoy nice things, but I am not high maintenance. I'm not judgemental, jealous or possessive. Everyone needs some space. I want an educated, successful man in his own right, who can take my hand and lead me. Someone who is equally yoked with me, physically, educationally, emotionally, and financially stable. I want a Christian man, who will be my hero. All my pics are current, but I am older than listed. Please have yours current also, and leave out the 5 people around you. I won't know who you are in the line up. I live on the Central Coast of CA, but I spent half my life in TX, with all the Southern values. I'm genuine down to earth, and grounded. I am not married to CA. I believe happiness is where the heart is. I'm open to living anywhere wirh theright person."

Hey give me credit I use to weigh over 300 lbs now down to 250. I work hard and work alot... I want to change my life and want to find a partner to love me and me love him. Someone that is as attracted to me as I am to him. Although I am not the best dancer in the world I love to dance all types of music except the rap crap ""yuk"" I am a family oriented person and would welcome a wonderful man that is willing to share his life with me and me with him. I don't want drama.... all I want is a peaceful relationship full of love, one in which we compliment each other. I don't want someone that is an alcoholic, drug addict, womanizer or with no goals in life ...I don't need that in my life and I will not settle for it either. Sorry but have to make sure you understand that--also I believe that if there is no chemistry on the 1st date there is probably no reason to pursue the relationship. Also, if you have a Harley it does not impress me (seen too many spinal cord and brain injuries as a result of motorcycle accidents)so be safe. Good Luck to Everyone in finding their special someone.....God Bless"

28,splatina,F,Some college,Hispanic,Number one reason why someone you contacted does not respond is because they are not attracted to you.. plain and simple.. and vice versa..we have a choice..people should get off the high horse they are riding..Single mom by choice..the fishing pond has very limited options and most of the time it’s you who puts the limits on yourself.. Time will show all your secrets.. why lie.. it’s gonna come out anyway.. just save yourself time and stop wasting others time.. so selfish and rude.If your looking for Ms perfect please leave this profile now.. she’s not here..if you have a vision in your head about what she looks like or how she HAS to be..she’s not here.. just saying
29,LoveMichi83,F,,Hispanic,"Hi, hope you are having an awesome and blessed day. My name is Michelle, thank you for your interest in reading my profile.... -> Looking for my best friend, in the hopes that one day, it will turn into marriage. Preferences: 5'10 or taller and age range 38-44 Raised in the USA: I am part French and part Mexican= Frenxican, LOLI was born in CD. Juarez Chihuahua Mexico (6yrs)Raised in El Paso TX (15years)Moved to Austin area to attend college and stayed We really like it here! (16years end of January) Important: What you are about to read, will keep the right men interested in me, and will keep the wrong guy away... I am not here for a ""free meal"" or anything like that. I am here looking for something serious. We learn from our experiences and become better individuals for our future. It's all about perspective and being positive! A little bit about myself: I am a single mother of three kids (from the same father). Their dad is in Houston visits them when he gets a chance. I keep myself busy with a full time job that I love, two part time jobs that only attend to about 2-6hrs a week, try to make time to hang out with my kids, and we are active at church. It really just depends what is going on. Please don't let all this discourage you from messaging me. I do make time to respond to texts on my breaks/lunch and will make time to hang out or go on a date with the man that really wants to be with me. I am a one man woman, and when I meet him and feel like he's The One, just then and only then, I will get off this site. First things first.... My best friend and true love must put God 1st.I am a devoted Christian woman, and I seek a man who is God centered and has a relationship with God. A God Centered Man: A true man of God is; trustworthy, honest, confident, respectful, serves others, fearless, compassionate, and loving. A true man of God is not; prideful, rude, sarcastic, disrespectful, mean, does not manipulate, nor will he hurt anyone in any way.My Walk as a devoted Christian woman: A little bit about why a relationship with God is important to me and my significant other needs to be a true faithful man of God....*I was born into a Christian family, however I never felt a relationship with God until now. My parents got divorced when I was a teenager and we stopped attending church, my mom lost faith. Later when I became an adult, I would attend church sometimes, read the Bible, and prayed. I believed that was enough.... but it wasn't.I went through sooo many things.... until one day I had nothing and had many many obstacles..... my mission leader told me one day, get on your knees and pray. I did and my life changed forever. God started answering my prayers, fast! I decided to get baptized at my current church, and be more involved serving others (teacher at church) and a student in bible studies. One day I asked God to use me in His favor.He annointed me with the Holy Spirit and sent me as a missionary to Mexico, and now I am also a prayer partner at church.**I still have lots to learn and do. I am not perfect. However, it is extremely important who we allow into our life, into our minds, and into our heart and soul. I learn from my mistakes, and make changes as I grow.Life is about changing, but changing for the better. A true relationship: I am here looking for my true love, a serious friendship that will turn into marriage, I am in no rush. To be friends 1st will allow us to get to know each other better; learning how to communicate with each other, develop trust, be honest, and respect each other's time. I am very confident about myself, I know exactly what I want and need. However, I am not perfect, but always improving. I have learned to be alone and not feel lonely.Relationships is something that we need to work on daily, showing respect, having communication, caring for each another, being honest, and being compassionate. What do you seek physically in a woman? Physically I call myself average. I am active-working out again. Walking, jogging, INSANITY (occasionally), and small weights. Body type is Not too big or small.I carry myself very well and I find myself attractive. My best attributes are my beautiful long wavy/curly hair, big brown eyes, nice lips, and long legs. Let's talk about LOVE: These are the 5 Love Languages: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch.This is how I feel about them: we all feel some are more important than the rest.... #1- Words of Affirmation (attention).Complementing each other Extremely Important. Makes you feel attracted to your significant other, more confident, and makes you feel positive and happy.It's really sad to feel lonely when you are next to someone who doesn't give you the attention nor do they talk to you. Sometimes it makes you feel that you are the only one doing it.... not good... starts making you doubt who you are with.#2- Quality Time When in a relationship, I believe it's important to do almost everything together. There's times that yes, we can enjoy being with friends without our significant other. As long as there is trust and communication.#3- Acts of Service I am a single mother of three kids, I don't have a man around. If there's anything to be done that might be more for a man to do, I'd like for the man in my life to step up and help. Or help others- super attractive #4- Receiving Gifts This is super important when starting a relationship. It makes each other feel special. This tells us that our significant other was thinking about us. #5- Physical Touch I seek a man I can call my best friend- which means I can trust in and won't judge me, but will know what to tell me. Be there for me when I need him the most. Someone I can be myself with and won't try to manipulate me to be someone I am not. Hugs and kisses are important in my culture- I am Mexican, hugs help in many ways: Helps release stress, feel loved, can take you from being mad to calm to down. Also, since I am obedient, Intimacy comes later in a relationship (marriage). We need all Five Love Languages in a Relationship.They are all important. If interested please don't be shy and send me a message.I seek my best friend; this creates trust, learn how to communicate, and to be honest with each other. The rest comes later, I am in no rush. Thank you for taking interest in reading my profile. Be safe and God bless "

31,RoxannenicoleM,F,Graduate Degree,Hispanic,"Simply looking for a serious man that can be FAITHFUL.I am a simple easy going women that is in search of a loving, passionate and outgoing man. I am easy to please and simply want honesty. If your looking for just a good time please move on to the next. I am not about games but a long term partner. In hopes of something more when the time is right. I am a Christian women, mother and hard worker and expect no less from a man. I believe in order for a relationahip to work your heart must belong to the Lord first. And the rest will fall into place. So again if you are not looking for something serious please don't waste both of our time. -I believe that life is way too short for games and lies. I am old fashion a believe in taking care of my man when he gets home with hot home cooked meals and knowing the deference between family time, work mode and our bed room time.

A white man who has a tan is a bonus! Sorry if this offends anyone.....just had to put it because of the e-mails I was receiving. Here's the story behind the headline: When I put ""chocolate lover"" (like milk chocolate to eat) on my profile, some men assumed I meant black men.....I kid you not! I can't make this stuff up! 2) Please live withing 45-60 minutes from my location. Ideally we all would like our ""partner"" to live right down the street. This is probably not going to happen. That being said, a dating relationship can not happen if people live too far apart. 3) Dating age range. A good dating age range is 10 years younger or 10 years older....for ANYONE period. No matter how ""young at heart you are, or how ""hot you think you are,"" if you aren't willing to date woman your own age that is a HUGE warning sign!!

Those women want you only if you have money, have ""Daddy-issues"", and will probably want to have kids. Get a grip Gramps!

As a courtesy, I am honest and upfront, please be kind and mannerly. Crude or inappropriate behavior won’t be tolerated. This is a “dating site, not a hook-up site.” Single means divorced......not separated. There is a difference. I know what I want (not need), I can be alone and not lonely, and don't want to waste anyone's time, so please don't waste mine. Be able to laugh at others as well as yourself! Be brutally honest with yourself first. What you are seeking in a mate, should also be the same things you can supply in a relationship. Send a message with a nice hello and a willingness to get to know one another. If you are going through a mid-life crisis, take too many gym selfies, and include pictures of your tattoos in your profile....go seek help, but please don’t contact me! My baggage in life is the size of a wallet, if you have some Samsonite.....please just keep on wheeling down the road! Lastly, good fishing requires the use of the right kind of bait.

My little buddy.....hit with dementia about 8 weeks ago.....gone from very bad to worse in 48....I’m afraid i’m faced with planning that last vet ‘visit’. Please be patient for any response you are waiting for.....thank you6/25/19 I took Max to the beach for the very last time over the weekend...........today I had to say good bye..........a kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love deeply and be loved in return.Looking for a man that is emotionally ready for the real deal. I want the whole pie in the sky, the goofy sappy kind of love that seems to be so elusive.............not looking for someone to complete me, but rather for someone who wants to hold hands while we walk our path together. Someone honest, loving, compassionate and that will tell me when I have spinach in my teeth! I'm not afraid to let a man take the lead; in some ways, I actually prefer it. (I know, that may seem odd fashioned, but it's just the way I am) However, double standards have no place in a mutually caring relationship.A relationship can settle down into a sort of complacency, you know. You forget the early passion, you forget the heat, you begin to feel comfortable in another sort of intimacy that has nothing to do with sex. Or if it does, it's only because the idea of being loved so completely, is in itself often sexually exciting. I used to say that faith is not a leap in the dark, but a journey in the light, but screw that I am ready to take that leap! You?That crazy little thing called love ... let me describe what I think love looks like in order for us to have a common platform from which to leap. Love is an action. Love is about building trust - when our words are consistent with our actions. Love is having the courage to be open and vulnerable. Love is visibility, friendship, mutual admiration, and strength. Love is the beauty contained within the simple pleasures we experience together. Holding hands. A passionate embrace. A text message to say hello ""just because"". Love is sharing basic values and similarities - with complementary differences. Love is building a future with you while being present in the moment with you. This can also mean a long meaningful walk, a bike ride, just sitting on a bench somewhere people watching. It's not so much about what we choose to do at any given time, it's about doing it together and being present in the moment. It’s kind of silly to state I would like someone that shares my values, why would I want someone who doesn’t?? However, we do not always have to be on the same page, just in the same book! There are times, I will even settle for being in the same set of the encyclopedias. I see many referring to 'baggage'. Well, if you don't have any you probably haven't lived much, and it's not about whether you have it, but how you've dealt with it. At our age we’ve all experienced hurt and/or disappointment on some level; that goes without saying. But maybe life isn’t about avoiding the bruises, maybe it’s about collecting the scars to prove that you showed up for the game.  I’m a very compassionate/empathetic person and pride myself on the ability to put myself in someone else’s shoes. I am a nurturer by nature, but don't let that fool you, I am not a pushover or a doormat. I also believe I’m excellent at treating others the way I would like to be treated, and good at the art of compromise in a relationship. I am looking for that special someone that is like minded, affectionate and comfortable showing that affection via a playful, honest, heartfelt spirit. I love being affectionate, but also feel there is no need to go overboard; sometimes all that is needed is that special look/glance at the perfect time. I have grown accustomed to being alone except for those times when loneliness sets in. I have been told by many that I am too independent. I don't 'need' a man in my life..(ok, I really do)....I 'want' one..........I dream of a man who touches me first thing in the morning, right before my body fully wakes, whose fingers entwine with mine during the day and who’s lips press kisses onto my eyelids as he brushes the hair from my face each night before sleep. I dream of a grown man that knows it is okay to cry and tremble at times, and that it is okay to feel scared about love, loss and loneliness. His vulnerability is what tenderly touches the hidden parts of me. I dream of a man that is not afraid to pull me close when a storms set in, and one who knows his touch is a powerful force when blowing and moving black clouds. I want a man who uses his strength, his sensuality, his softness and sexuality to touch me, physically, intimately, and deeply through my mind, body and soul. Love, happiness, peacefulness, pleasure, honesty, trust, and faithfulness, all these words are what I want to have in my relationship. My perception of an ideal relationship is one in which a loving environment is fostered through mutual respect and genuine interest for each other’s work/interest/life and families. My word is my bond; it's all about integrity. (it's a military thing, HOOAH)I’m really good at: Not being judgmental.Looking at both sides of an argument.Accepting that I cannot change people.Being supportive when the occasion calls for itGiving away knowledge. Knowing a little to a moderate amount about a lot of things, but not a lot about one thingTrying new things..........stepping outside my comfort zone."

97,sungirltx,F,PhD / Post Doctoral,Caucasian,"Bonjour! Guten Tag! Siza! I am a mature working professional that seeks a mature person like myself. You must have a job and your own place. While I put in 200% effort at the office, I am also a lover of life. I love learning, have a sense of wanderlust and highly committed mother to my two children. I have a cat and a dog that are loved members of our family. I value my relationships with family and friends that are living around the globe and visit them whenever I have a chance. I have a strong faith that informs my life. I enjoy a balance of dressing to impress and leggings days. After 25 years of red hair I recently went blonde and I am loving it! I am not one to be with someone that doesn’t have career aspirations. I am attracted to intelligent, go getters that have their eye on the prize. I am inspired by people that know what they want and are willing to do what it takes to make things happen. I believe life is like a create your own ending story, one where every day you pen another page. I am looking for someone that shares my goals, values and aspirations for life. We don’t have to be identical, but having a set of things you’re passionate about is an essential ingredient. I want to be with someone that can teach me something. He enjoys trying new things and isn’t afraid to get in the car or catch a flight or try a new cuisine. He is a spiritual person that like me has found faith to be an important part in life decisions. He is someone that has a vision for where he would like to be in the next 5, 10 or 20 years. I carry myself like a true lady and I am seeking a gentleman that will see my worth. I am seeking someone that will bring out the best in me, as I hope to be able to bring out the best in you. If you think you could challenge me to become the best version of myself... if you love dreaming about the future and your next adventure, please contact me. "

I am down to earth and enjoy great conversations. While I love people, I keep my circle rather small, being that REAL PEOPLE rarely exist anymore. I am not about games. I am spontaneous and I'll take certain chances from time to time. What I am looking for is an intelligent male (knowledge is an attractive trait) (nerds are a turn on) who is seeking an associate/friend to get to know and and open to see where it may go. I am a positive person who enjoys someone who thinks outside of the box.I would describe myself as an eclectic, artsy type of person whom is open for discussions about almost anything. If you send me a note, and I dont respond, its probably because I saw or read something that I did not like or interest me. I am open and honest, as I hope you will be.KIK: Klimisa"

106,Austin6702,F,Graduate Degree,Caucasian,"Hello, Here's a little about me- I enjoy doing a variety of things and love listening to live music. I am just as happy going out for a meal as cooking at home. A dinner for two is always something special and cooking together can be pretty fun. Cuddling up to watch a good movie or sharing a bottle of wine is also nice and time with family and friends is great, wherever it is. I am a very thoughtful, honest person with a great sense of humor. I have 2 beautiful girls, who amaze me most days and are In college, so I have the time to invest in meeting and getting to know someone. Faith and family are central to who I am. I enjoy sports and grew up playing soccer and swimming and watching football, baseball, basketball and golf and enjoy going to and watching sporting events. Taking part is pretty fun too and I'm game to try most things. I recently joined a gym and try to get there as often as possible , although am working on increasing the frequency!Being outside and active is where I'm happiest, but also enjoy lying in a hammock by the lake and relaxing. Kayaking and walking/ hiking are my favorite activities and I just enjoy being near the water and in the fresh air. I really enjoy traveling, but I've learned that where I am isn't as important as who I'm with. I am very easy going and get along with just about everyone. I am very genuine, have no hidden agendas and do not play games. My friends would describe me as generous, loyal, thoughtful, compassionate, fun, funny and kind. I am looking for a relationship and am hoping to meet someone with integrity, who is fun, adventurous, thoughtful and faithful, as well as someone who is family oriented.If what I've said strikes a chord with you, send me a message and we can see where it goes from there."

109,hayls71,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"I am asked if I am searching for a long-term relationship, a short-term relationship or a hookup? My answers to those questions are undetermined at this point. I want a relationship. A good one. A positive one and a fun one. I am searching for that someone that enjoys their time spent with me and I enjoy my time spent with them. Nothing more nothing less.I'm a Texan, grew up in East Texas. I moved here to Austin in 1993. I consider myself a tomboy. I also enjoy being a girl. I like wearing dresses. And yes, heels are absolutely sexy on, but they are not comfortable to walk in. I wear my dresses with cowboy boots or converse. I have worked in Dental for almost 20 years. At my current office since 2010. I have also restored homes, restored Airstreams and with family. I lost both parents last year. Life is short and sometimes even shorter. My future plan is to move to the mountains. I'm going to start with Red River NM. I enjoy going fishing and camping. Friends say I'm humorous and outgoing. Friends also say I'm sometimes unnecessarily sensitive, and sometimes I talk to much. I make efforts to talk to listen and not talk to just be heard. I have my insecurities. I also have confidence. I guess that's considered pros and cons? I see it as my attributes. Okay, this about me is getting long. Wake up!! I have rewritten this several times. I've deleted my profile several times. I needed it to be more humorous, more outgoing. I need to come across sexy and smart. No matter what I write and rewrite, some of you will see those things in me. And some of you will not.I try to reply to all messages promptly. It's nice to receive them. And even if I'm not interested, I will let you know. And I hope you will not take that negatively or personal. I often don't log off after checking my messages/ viewing profiles. I just close the app. So I'm not always online here even though it may look that way. After receiving some negative messages, I felt I needed to explain that. Online can be exciting - so many profiles! And also frustrating - so...so..so.. many profiles. Real? Fake? GMO? Look! Squirrel! Grass is green on all sides of pastures, if watered and if fertilized by poop."

While I'm a Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Neil Young and Steely Dan kind of gal, I listen to a wide variety of music......country, 80's, 90's, hair bands, too many genres to list.

I was riding horses ever since I can remember and understand them better than people some of the time... ! I love animals. I enjoy everything that has to do with the outdoors and on the water.... motorcycle rides.. country-western dancing.. rodeos... I Love the beach for sunbathing and romantic walks in the evening.. the mountains for hiking and all the places in between for exploring. I am adventurous, active, and willing to try almost anything once! I guess you could say I'm a tad bit of a tomboy, because my daddy never had any boys, so I was his constant sidekick when I was growing up, he taught me how to train, love and respect horses and other animals., the trade of woodworking.. to learn and understand sports, fishing and hunting. Nothing is more peaceful than going to a deer lease, with your friends, relaxing with the smell of bacon and a campfire in the crisp, cold morning air.... Now, Now Boys, before you have me pictured as calamity Jane; I can guarantee you, I'm 100% woman.. One little bundle of dynamite that you won't forget!  My momma was a great teacher to me as well, she taught me everything I needed to know to keep my man satisfied and happy... through her actions and commitment to my dad, I learned the upmost importance of honesty, trustworthiness, faithfulness and the ability to love someone with all your heart.. Through his stomach, by cooking, baking, getting up early to make breakfast. .. The importance to set the table and have a family meal together . Emotionally, by always being a good listener, to be selfless and supportive.. compassionate and to always remember to hug, cuddle and snuggle those that we love the most. And let them know how much you care for and love them each and everyday..Physically, by taking pride in living healthy, exercising and taking good care of myself, through hygiene as well; Everyman loves the smell of a woman's hair and body when they are freshly bathed, with just the hint of perfume.. ... Keeping a nice clean home. for your man to come home to . . Most importantly, Spiritually, that all things are possible with Our Lord Jesus Christ. To never give up and never ever to go to bed mad.. and to keep this in mind in any relationship ..   If you are still reading, I suppose I have sparked your interest.. I also have a very good heart and when I love, I love with all of it ... Im honest, considerate and respectful, I was raised that way; I still call my elders by sir and ma'am..  I love to laugh and I have a funny sense of humor, I seriously laugh at myself every day for some silly thing that I said or did. I love to cook and bake, entertain and have get togethers, the holidays and Spending time with family and friends..  I love my children and grandchildren with all my heart! Family is very important to me. .. With that said, they are all independent and don't need me as much anymore. So I am free to travel or for the right reasons even relocate.  I have the education, experience and trade that allows me to be financially independent. .. I'm looking for a real good man that has qualities and interests much the same as my own...

187,47Strings,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"Note: I don't have the Meet Me capability. If you're interested, drop me a note.If Myers-Briggs is accurate, I’m an INFJ with INTJ tendencies. I’m not shy and consider myself an outgoing introvert. But when I want to recharge my batteries, I prefer being with just a few people.Since my hobbies are solo pursuits, let's come up with some things we can do together. Got any ideas?As for religion or spirituality, I swing between agnostic and atheist. While in my world there are no gods (except for perhaps the god of traffic, who has a truly nasty sense of humor), I support the right to believe as you choose. However, if you’re a fundamentalist anything, including a fundamentalist atheist, pass me by, please.Because I don’t believe in divine intervention or an afterlife or karma, I do believe that we humans have a duty to each other to seek justice, fairness and equality for everyone. If there is a wrong, do what you can to change it. If there is a need, fill it. No god is going to do it for us. Offer comfort and compassion always - simple kindness ripples outward in unseen ways, finding those who need it.My job is logic driven, very detail oriented and not in the least creative. It’s in my non-working time that I indulge in creative pursuits that feed my spirit. I read, practice the harp, cook, and write lyrics. I wrote some lyrics several years ago for a song that was recorded and made it onto the Americana chart. Even got played in Sweden - go figure. I’m working on several other songs at the moment, but I’ve got a time problem. I’ve taken some kilnforming glass classes and am addicted - I love the sound of breaking glass. I have many designs in my head and I’m looking forward to seeing them in real life.I’m looking for a man who is educated and wise, kind and compassionate, verbal, has his own thing, has a fully functioning moral compass and a strong back bone, lives a healthy lifestyle, and has a wicked sense of humor. If you are a “special needs” guy, as in all your needs are special at the expense of others, let’s not. The majority of life is spent on the mundane, so I’m looking for a man whose company I so enjoy that even the mundane stuff is fun.My goals for the future are to learn to play as many instruments as I can (sitar or kora would be cool), design and make more kilnformed glass pieces, learn about gardening and aquaponics, become the wisest and most loving human being I can be, understand as much about the human condition as I can and work for its betterment. Of course, I'm going to have to sneak that in with making the beds, taking out the trash, doing the laundry, getting the oil changed, mowing the yard, mopping the floors.... If you’re interested, write and tell me how you think we mesh.Best of luck to us all."

They will stand by you till the end and make you feel special and important. You won’t feel alone or unwanted when with them. You will feel accepted and valued.

255,DelilahZz,F,Masters Degree,Black,"I'm a very energetic, outgoing, athletic, Sapiosexual who is very adventurous and loves outdoor activities. I'm open to entertaining the company of a man who is athletic/in shape (no extra lbs), loves travel partner (Passport in hand), is adventure and wants new experiences. At this stage of my life I'm not into games unless it's a scavenger hunt for fun. I'm light hearted and free spirited. I don't allow any complainers, drama or negative attitude dudes around me.What A Guy Must HaveHe must bring positive energy only, be between 40-50 and stand over 5'9"", love to work out, be healthy and be a man of substance who is not prone to cursing, vulgarity or drunkenness. I'm not really searching for anyone. I'm here to see what I can see and meet new people because I am new to the area. I am very career focused, driven and travel a lot. So a relationship doesn't fit into my focus right now. Although, I wouldn't mind having a travel companion from time to time. If you have 0 profile photos I'm not even interested in you. The same goes for old outdated photos. If you were in shape 10 years ago but now you aren't but you still posting old pictures I'm not interested. To me that shows you have secrets and you aren't the same as your photos. Every last one of my photos have been taken within the last 3 months. I work out and eat right....I'm not thirsty so I won't just fool with any ole dude. Plus I make my own money so I'm not looking to be taken care of either. I can stand on my own. I want a partner who's the same.Lastly I Do Not Do 'Hookups' nor do I sleep around so if that's what you looking for - Keep It Pushing. If any of what I said irritates you - You Aren't The One For Me. See simple and easy. Not willing to settle for just ""any old dude"" ever again. Looking for above average type of man who's on my level.____I get asked ""Why Are You Singe"" all of the time. It's easy to answer. I KNOW MY WORTH AND I'M NOT SETTLING FOR JUST ANY DUDE JUST TO SAY I HAVE A MAN. I'm Fabulous Single until the right one comes along. I have too much going for me to waste my time with just anybody."

Hopefully you enjoy it too - let's get sweaty (in the gym) together!For fun I like to hang out with friends, hit up a nice happy hour, listen to live music or poetry, check out a fun museum (the kids museum is the best, and because I'm short people usually don't even notice that I'm a grown-up LOL!), travel and of course shop!

304,chulitatuya1958,F,Some college,Hispanic,"Hello ! I enjoy what life has to offer. Zest for life. My passions are dancing, music, biking, crafting, nature, hiking, traveling, fun times, movies !All that being stated. I have had to also include the following caution :All scammers, players, users, proceed with caution. I have reported 3 scammers in as many days on this site.I do not use dating sites for playing games or scams. I am serious about connecting with my God given soulmate. To grow old with.I know my worth. I know what I want and need. I am self assured. I have self love and self respect. I know how to love, care & appreciate.The last 2 scammers were hilarious. They actually admitted having studied my written profile. This is a re-do for my profile. Prompted by the scammers preying on single women’s written profiles. Using such greetings as “Gorgeous”, “ Stunning”. That initial red flag only makes me ??????I know the various scripts you clowns use. Time wasted trying to scam would go to better use by working a real job to earn the money. LOSERS,Beware > no scammer, player or user will get very far with this Pro. ??Too wise, savvy, and alert to be taken by anyone using dating sites for anything but finding true love.The other made obvious red flag. These Clowns either ask for your phone number right off. Or they message their number right away in order to get your phone number. I don’t rush into relationships. It takes time to get know the soul of the person. Anything worth having takes time !All that being stated. All scammers, players and users will be reported and blocked. Whom ever is interested in getting to know me. Let’s begin by getting better acquainted by messaging and if things progress nicely; we would meet for a relaxed lunch or dinner. I do not publicly define everything about me. I rather get to know the person face to face. These scammers I have had to report then block. Only prey on what they read about the single woman and use that to draft their scripts.The more scammers that prey, the more we learn. They reveal themselves so easily. And; Upping your game will not get far with me. ??Guys : Beware. The female scammers are lurking all over these dating sites as well. Thank you for visiting my profile. Wishing you the very best in your journey to connect with that true love. ??"
305,NeneMcLin,F,Some college,Black,"Hello my name is Cornelia and my friends call me Nene.I like to Travel,Dinner Dates,Love Movies,Taking Walks.My interest are looking for someone who is serious about dating no games!I do have a Sense of humor??I do attend Church on Sundays and I love Family.I Njoy listening to Old School R&B,Blues.My goal is to continue in Medical Field.I Njoy spending time with family,nieces,nephews.My Birthday is December23 I will be 54yrs old.I have 1son who is 28yrs old.My free time I like to chill watch TV or read a good book."
306,divasolovely,F,Bachelors Degree,Black,"In my ""Happy Place"" of life...Not that all things are perfect BUT my persona/mindset says, ""Life is not about getting through the storms but rather about dancing in the rain""...A mantra that I live by. Life will always present lemons at various stages. Take the lemons+squeeze+sugar=lemonade. What a delightful outcome...LOVE me some lemonade (smile)!Hmmm...A little about me...The most important thing to know is that I have an incredible relationship with GOD that is intimate, unusual and FUN! Please note I am not about religion but rather RELATIONSHIP. I am balanced, fun-loving yet serious when appropriate, family oriented, educated(college as well as common sense splashed with wisdom:-), affectionate, sensual(this is not synonymous with sexual...smile),passionate and articulate in my methods of communicating. I would also characterize myself as interdependent(used to say independent but growth dictated I change that), motivated, great listener, optomistic, charismatic, romantic and flirtatious...yes flirtatious, but respectfully so (wink).An entrepenuer at heart, I am ambitious and actively pursuing goals but in a relaxed manner that comes with wisdom. I LOVE with a passion what I do. I am dreaming a dream that is SOooo big that without GOD I will surely fail. My dreams have translated into vision and purpose. Any dreamers/visionarians (Is that even a word...oh we'll somebody call Webster's Dictionary, operating in my creative vein...lol) out there???I enjoy a multiplicity of things to include...worship,traveling, museums, bookstores (nerdy huh lol), watching a beautiful sunset, walking the beachside mesmerized by the ripple of waves created by the tide (this would be doubly pleasurable shared with ""The One”, working out, shooting pool, listening to some smooth jazz/r&b(enjoy venues with live bands),enjoying a cup of starbucks (or quality blend of coffee) while writing (one of my passions). I am currently writing my first manuscript that I hope to have completed soon.Although I did indicate in my profile long-term, allow me to clarify. I believe that any viable relationship begins with a friendship first. If there is Christ, chemistry, and compatibility (my 3 c's), it can progress into something more serious/long-term. I am definitely open to/desiring a serious relationship, but that isn't where I begin. I enjoy the JOURNEY of a FABULOUS friendship. A man with a zest for life and capable of effectively communicating his REAL feelings, fears, dreams, etc...is appealing to me. I especially enjoy interacting with individuals who can stimulate my intellect AND take a risk to become vulnerable . Though I have been disappointed in love, I am in no way bitter. I am not afraid of being vulnerable to love when it presents. Yes, I am a hopeless romantic(smile). I look forward to meeting my life-mate(some would refer to as soul-mate). You know...the one who years into the relationship still possesses the ability to make your heart skip a beat when gazing into their eyes...hmmm.Should any of this peak your interest, talk to me :-)."
307,Jesika9,F,Masters Degree,Hispanic,If I share now I’ll spoil all the fun of getting to know each other .If I’ve removed my photos then I’m taking time off or busy getting to know someone. I’m certain you would appreciate the same courtesy. 
308,AkilaUno,F,Some college,Black,"I travel a lot...love my life and am surrounded by cool people that add to it daily... I’m honest, loyal, silly/goofy, a good conversationalist and have a good heart that has been abused but not so much that I’m not willing to welcome and accept love again.I am looking to date and get to know people in my area and see what happens from there.... one day a time... nothing rushed/hurried...I’m not desperate or pressed PLEASE BE NEAR OR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ME. I AM ONLY INTERESTED IN LOCAL. NO LONG DISTANCE. IF I CANT SEE YOU ON ANY GIVEN DAY BECAUSE OF DISTANCE THAT WILL NOT WORK FOR ME, IF YOU INSIST ON REACHING OUT BUT YOU'RE NOT IN MY AREA I WILL NOT REPLY AND WILL BLOCK YOU. SINGLE OR DIVORCED MEN ONLY..NOT SEPARATED OR IT’S COMPLICATED If you’re not consistent save OUR time.... men hunt....it’s your role...but you’ve got to follow it up..make plans...and execute...I am a YOUNG 48... I love music and will listen to everything from Cardi B to the OJays.... but my radio is typically on Hip hop...Migos, Future, Elle Mai, Sza, etc... I drink, dance and an a very progressive woman..,,My preference is TALL men...I wear a lot of heels but that’s not a deal breaker just a preference No gold teeth or grills..Not into casual sex or hook ups..."

316,srort05,F,Some college,Hispanic,"I’m not gonna sit here and say that I’m not looking for a relationship or that I am, I like taking things as they go. I’m very picky who I let in my life because I’m not here to waste time plain and simple. I’m old enough to know what I want in life and I’m not in a age of being petty or on some petty shit.

320,NewBeginnings79,F,High school,Hispanic,"I really appreciate all of the messages that I have received. If I have not responded, it’s most likely because of:1) attraction is important. It’s not the only thing, but there has to be something there that attracts me to you.2) I like men who are taller than 5’10”. It’s just a personal preference.3) you’re waaaaay too into yourself on your profile. I am not attracted to a man who uses snap chat filters or has photos of him shirtless in front of the mirror. Once again, just personal preference.4) your dating profile says you’re not looking for anything serious. 5) YOU DONT HAVE PICTURES! don’t message me if you do not have A picture of your face up!! PLEASE! In that being said, I’m ambitious and not afraid to take risks. Only the healthy ones though... if you’re not sure of who you are as a person, I’m not for you. I am attracted to men who see the good in people, stable, drug and smoke free. I love sports, dancing, and anything active. I’m pretty down to earth and easy to talk to. I officially don’t move to San Antonio till the end of July but I don’t know a single soul there so I’m hoping to meet a really good man and can show me around the new city. I have always had a love for SA and I’m hoping to find a different kind of love there too ??What I’m able to offer:Honesty Fun AdventureLoyalty Excitement LaughsStability No drama Affection I want to be the joy in someone’s life, so please be mine in return.

324,denlew56,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"Hi y'all, I'm a young-looking, young and kind-hearted, down-to-earth optimist, hoping to find someone special for a possible long term relationship.

I'm honest, healthy, fit, and would only consider someone with similar attributes."
325,sandrasatx,F,High school,Native American,"A little about me I'm a hard working lady started working at the age 14. A proud mom of two children and a grandma to a beautiful granddaughter. I can say I've learn by my mistakes not perfect and not a model working on getting back in shape. I enjoy spending time with family and friends it's the little things in life are memorable and priceless. Something I say, if you don't have nothing nice to say then you don't say nothing at all. I'm a friendly person, honest, loving, caring, loyal, and respect other as I would like it in return. Love and commitment is the key to a good relationship being able to communicate with each other forgetting about who's right and wrong work them out together because it takes two to be there for each other.

If I see you have shown up in my Meet Me list a lot, but no message. I will continue to swipe left until YOU message. "
328,TexasAngel0510,F,Some college,Caucasian,"I'm a very down to Earth person who doesn't judge others. I like to cook but it sucks cooking for one person. I would like to meet and start off as friends then go from there. I'm not looking for a one night stand or a friends with benefits situation. Also, if you don't live in San Antonio or the surrounding areas please move on because I don't date someone long distance. Thanks for stopping by!"

331,eajames1981,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian," Love Jesus, conservative, pro 2nd amendment, workout... a lot, live art, the outdoors, traveling, animals, and time with family."
332,Julep,F,Graduate Degree,Black,"Very tall SBF new to Austin, and travels a little bit in my career.. Occasionally I might act a little silly at sometimes but the truth is I am very intelligent, educated (multi Bach. degrees & a Masters). I understand no one is perfect and I will admit to my flaws. I have no issues with my self-esteem (ENFP personality type). I am a BBW- big curvy & tall woman that is well aware of what I look like, and I think I am adorable (& I post updated pics)! My current size is XL, & my gym goal is to work on my muscle development for my curvy frame. I'm active and I like being outdoors, but if you have issues with body types, please bypass me. I'm a faithful and awesome a friend to have, and most seem to think of me as a sister.. I love swimming and working out, so if you know your way around in a gym, definitely hit me up. I'm fun and down to earth, and a cancer survivor who embraces the joy each new day can bring. I believe in being civil; and I'm the type who will follow up in communicating (even if it is to wish you well and part ways). Just here to make friends and hangout for now. I haven't been successful in making friends as a newbie to the area, and so that's my M.O. I'm not hip, nor do I smoke/drink. I tend to be observant of men and more interested in their behaviors . This doesn't mean I am a sexual prude; it means that I know that there is a time and place for everything. Sex is NOT the FIRST thing you should discuss with a stranger, but I can converse on it when I get to know you. I believe in things happening at their own pace. I am a highly passionate person and seek that trait in others. If I'm pleased, I will always make sure those around me are even more so. FYI I am a SCORPIO, if you are into zodiacs.  Although I no longer live in Houston, I still love taking in the city life. I like traveling and going out but I don't get to do this much these days. I recently moved to the Austin area. I'm can really appreciate refined folks in suits & silk, but know I grew up kind of country.  I like interesting, intelligent people who do not hang on to baggage and truely enjoy life. I don't usually have hang-ups about race, gender nor age. Fairly open minded, as long as I feel I am being RESPECTED. I have a soft spot for children & animals, and an unexplainable fascination with redheads (still trying to figure that one out). I'm often described as very friendly easy-going, but I am by no means a push-over...I stand my ground and yet know when to be flexible. I am told I am somewhat unconventional, but I am who I am, and if that is different, so be it. My biggest pet peev is being told a pretty lie vs an uglier truth (respect me enough to give me the option of handling reality). I feel that basic manners to respond to those who write, even if it is to say ""no thank you"". I am learning how to play golf, but I have played rugby. I am a horrid speller and I always have lip gloss nearby. The last time a guy left me speechless, he sung karaoke pitch perfect, in the style of Steve Perry. I'll put care into looking good, but I love to go fishing and ""mudding"". I'm comfortable in jeans and can change my ride's oil. I am a good listener, and I am drawn to shy people as a challenge. I am the loyal friend most say they want but few people have.  I believe in treating people like they want to be treated. I am slow to anger, and I try to give everyone a benefit of a doubt.. If I can be summed up in one word, I think it would be ""KIND"". I could go on and on about myself, but it would not come close to really telling you who I am.WHAT I LIKE IN OTHERS: a good sense of humor, compassion, nice smiles, creativity, honesty, passionate about life, open minded and a competitive spirit. I generally am drawn to people older than myself. Seeing a guy in a well made suit is what dreams are made of, lol. I also have a soft spot for self-declared ""nerds"", ""dorks"" and ""geeks"". There is nothing wrong with not fitting in the box!I tend to hop profiles in a quiet manner. Chances are I saw something interesting about you if I ninja'ED by your profile here :)"
333,prcanno,F,High school,Caucasian,"I love to laugh. So a sense of humor is a must. I get asked often why am I single; because I haven't met somebody that I want to be in a relationship with. I also get asked what I'm looking for on here. I'm not looking to get laid, because I can go out and have sex anytime I want. I want to find somebody worth getting to know and see where it goes from there. I can't stand liars, cheaters, or pushy men; I find all those types to be turn offs. I want to find somebody who can stand on their own two feet! I don't care what car you drive. If you own your own house or not, or how much money you make. I'm not here for all that! But on a side note: find tattoos attractive I tend to go for the tall guy. I'm extremely active and need somebody who can keep up with me."
334,SweetluvButterfly83,F,Some college,Hispanic,"Im a single mother. I work a lot. I don''t have time for games or bullshit. I know my worth and I won't settle for less. If you serious about getting to know someone who's old fashion, loves to talk on the phone and is homebody most of the time then send me a message."
335,MsLuvableV,F,Bachelors Degree,Black,"Someone to be honest understanding satisfying belonging affectionate needful and dedicated as well being funny loving and caring. He most definitely needs to be able too communicate with his partner. Definitely not looking for anyone who is into games or catfishing women!!

404,8bellaleah8,F,Some college,Caucasian,"Do not select “meet me” because I’m not an upgraded member. I believe in paying it forward and helping others, because I know what it’s like to do without. A simple smile and a sincere “how was your day” can brighten someone’s evening. Being respectful, humble, loyal, grateful and responsible are some of my qualities I am wanting to share with my life partner. I prefer to sit by a cozy fire after a home cooked meal having an interesting conversation than a lavish evening out while being “wined and dined” because I’m not a materialistic kind of gal.I was born and raised in Del Rio, Tx which is the border of Mexico and Texas. I’m biracial White/Mexican so I’m bilingual. I don’t have any children but I do have cats and dogs that are all rescues. I’m the middle child of 3. I enjoy being outdoors than inside. I prefer the simple things in life like the sun rays on my skin as I sit on my hammock. I wish I knew how to 2step. I prefer to drive and clean without shoes on. Different alcoholic drinks distinguish my mood. Margaritas makes me want to dance, wine gets me sensual and Zeigen Bock is favorite beer. I believe in loyalty and treat my man like a king. House and clothes cleaned daily, home cooked meals, no frozen nor ramen noodles allowed in my pantry.My ideal partner must be able to speak in complete sentences, doesn’t not smoke anything, doesn’t dip, is not a gamer, has a job and a vehicle to start. Ask me anything, I’m not shy."

Dont msg me telling me you know what you want but then disappear from messaging because your hiding from someone. If you message me and i take awhile to respond. Its not because i cant or dont want to. Its because i literally have over 200 or more messages that i get on a daily bases and i cant get to all of them. And i apologies for it. Thats the main reason why my photos are put up off and on. Because my phone blows up. And thank you all for who i spark some interest to. Im looking for a great tall nice kind honest respectful individual. I have no drama and i definitely dont want to assiciate with anyone who tries and turns things around making me feel like im the bad person because you are a shallow person for not getting things your way. Im done with all the stupidity and i am not a person to be ugly or disrespectful just because we may not have anything in common or if your not what im looking for. If nothing more...I've made a friend. So respect that. Please!!

I want to explore life with someone who isn't afraid of new things or new places.I want someone to dance in the kitchen with me. Someone who will sit next to me in conversation and also in silence. I can take care of myself and do that very well, but it would be nice to find someone to come home to. I want a partner, someone who can take the lead every once in a while... not wait for me to do it all... I'm a grown up and pretty smart--- all in a nice package. I deserve your consideration and appreciate your effort.@@@@@@  I can't see ""wants to meet you"", so leave a message if you'd like to meet.  #### I'm not a hookup kind of person, but expect a high level of physical interaction.And no jealousy please....

438,boganna,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"I am truly looking for someone who is mature and ready for a relationship. Someone who wants to find a relationship where both people give 100% to maintaining the spark that was there in the beginning. If any of the following interests you, please MESSAGE me. I promise I won’t bite. Aren't you tired of those average girls? They all say, ""I'm looking for someone special, and I like to have fun."" Well you won't find any of those cliché's here. Try out an exceptional woman for once. I'll challenge you. And I want you to challenge me.To give you some insight into my contrariness: - I am successful in my job, but I believe in traditional gender roles.- I am independent, but I yearn for a strong partner to lead me.- I have deeply held beliefs, but I'm always open to listening to opposite arguments.- I'm looking for a fellow sapiophile, but I enjoy silly movies (like Tommy Boy and Elf)I admire a man who is a strong Christian and an old fashioned gentleman. I love to banter, and I have been told I have a quick wit. Try me out, and see if I live up to the hype. I have a big heart and a lot of love to give to the right person. That being said - you will not see that side of me until I feel comfortable and I feel I can trust you with my sensitive heart. On a first meeting you will meet the intelligent, considerate, witty, flirty me. An awesome girl, but you will not see the deeper, more sensitive, seductive, loving me. That is reserved for those who spend some effort getting to know me and take the TIME to do so. I WANT to find love, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my heart to do so. When I make the step to meet someone I look for reasons to say yes and continue the interaction. I will give you every benefit of the doubt, but I have a nose like a bloodhound for BS, and I will call you on it.I'm not perfect, and I don't expect you to be. I do expect you to be a work in progress. I pride myself on always trying to improve. I've made a recommitment to living a healthier lifestyle. I've lost over 50 pounds since November 2016. Slow but steady wins the race. I'm not here to have an online relationship. I like to meet in person as soon as possible. No matter how much chemistry there may be online or over the phone, it is always different in person. The whole point of this endeavor is to have a relationship in REAL LIFE - at least it is for me. I don't use the Meet Me app, so you'll just have to message me if interested. "

I love Austin and all it has to offer. I am a NY girl (State, not city).For fun:Outdoors....I am not too much of a be-in-the-sun kind of person but put me in the shade with an iced tea and I am content to do most things. I do love the sun. I just don't want to be directly in it. If I am outside, I love to swim or just be near water, mess around in my flower beds or maybe sit around and do nothing. I like to camp every once in a while. I find it very relaxing spending a few days outside, around a fire, spending time with my friends and generally “getting away”.Now for indoors....I like to cook and I do it almost every day. I try to eat a decently “clean” diet. I wish I was a better cook but I almost never use a recipe.I like the occasional video game. I do not play anything with regularity but it is nice to escape into one.In and Outside....I enjoy seeing local live music and going out dancing. This does NOT mean that I am a huge party animal. I am social, outgoing and love the general energy of somewhere that has something to dance to. I also enjoy going to low-key kind of places... some good beer on a random day after work. I also like little adventures like going to the hill country to get some lunch at a place I feel I NEED to check out. Will try almost anything....Almost.About me....I am:LoyalAffectionateOutgoing – I can talk to almost anyoneIndependentHomeownerCompassionateSarcastic (which is the nice was of saying smart-ass)I wear heels often (just FYI that I am sometimes 3-4 inches taller)Love all kinds of music but country is on the lower endI know how to sail a boatI know how to shoot a gunLove coffee and craft beerDon't like being coldTraits I find appealing:OutgoingNot jealous*Affectionate*Not racist or homophobic*Able (or willing to try to) fix thingsLikes their job (don't have to love it)Noticed and cared that all of this was spell & grammar checked (hope I got it all)Now if you made it all this way.....You found my pictures appealing enough to continue. Thank you. I did try to capture the real “me”.Please note that the *'d items above are deal breakers. If you do message me with an indication that you really read all of this, I will probably reply. If you send 1-2 sentences that seem copied and pasted, I will probably not reply.Thank you and best of luck to us all."

Love to cook and have friends over to barbeque. I’ve traveled to many different places and so far, Italy is my favorite destination. I could live there!I have 2 adult daughters, not living at home, and 3 beautiful grandchildren. I go to a nondenominational church. The friends that I have made there have been such an awesome support for me. Wouldn’t trade them for the world!Laughter and sense of humor are very important to me.

I enjoy my job.Time, good conversation & touch are my love languages.  My goal is regular time together, home and out but I also enjoy my separate time. I am self sufficient and happy and seek the same.I appreciate a southern gentleman with manners who hasn’t forgotten the art and value of old school dating and romance. I like confidence, not arrogance. My special someone is a kind man, future grandpa material, not jaded, doesn't turn every discussion into a debate and is able to allow others to have their own opinions about politics and religion. Must understand the difference between affection and clingy and the difference between sexual and sensual. Must be available to date some weeknights and on the weekends.I am a lady, not a lay. If you just want sex please skip me. If you want a mama, skip. Once monogamous I do enjoy sex several times a week if schedules permit. If you have no sex drive skip me. That being said, understand i will not just be slipping into your bed. I want to know you and like you which requires dating. If I am not drawn to you as a person I will not desire you sexually. Appeal to my humor and intellect. I do not send nude pics or explicit details. Please don't ask or send.My profile pretty much spells it out. Looking for that one monogamous relationship that combines romantic dates, time in everyday life, emotional attachments and hot sex. I don't need to marry again but I've learned to never say never. I like my alone time so can feel smothered by someone who latches on to me as an instant life. I have been told that's just because it's not the right man. That when the right one comes along we will feel inseparable and not smothered or tethered. We've all had our own journeys at this point and feel we know what we want next, but the truth is that if that ""just right fit"" fell into our laps all preconceived rules and plans would fly out the window because we couldn't have possibly anticipated such joy and ease. So here I am trolling the pond, again. LOLInitial messaging here is fine for pre-screening and initial chatting but I prefer to meet in person to see if whit, humor, conversation and chemistry click. There's so much lost in messaging. We are humans not computers and really need the voice tone, body language, laughter, scents, and eye contact to get the full connection. I do not give my cell or email out til we meet. No Drunks, OneNightStands or FWB"

483,RED78752,F,Masters Degree,Black,"""I'm just a girl, looking for a guy, in search of love ~ Sex and the City: Carrie BradshawSo at this point I am only on this site waiting for the right person to find me for companionship, great conversation, movies, traveling, shopping, sightseeing, or just doing nothing but sitting on the couch with a glass of wine and a movie.. Ethnicity is not a barrier... I am very driven, I work hard and have many goals and dreams to accomplish. I am not a procrastinator. When I am ready to go for something, I go for it. This is good and bad. I am often taking on more than most can chew, but I chew it and keep it moving nonetheless. I am very into politics and fighting against social injustice. On paper I am a democrat/liberal however I am more centered. I don't care what party you are, and you can support who you support, however if you live in the Trump bubble and ignore his lack of decency.....morals..... a brain (lol) and pretend like what is happening is not really happening then we will not be a good match. I don't debate, I can have a discussion on realistic things but playing ignorance to reality is not toleratedWhat qualities am I looking for in a man..... Hmmm.... Someone who has an understanding of the 5 Love Languages. If you don't know what that is google it. Someone who knows what their love language is and can communicate it, however, and equally important, a man willing to learn her love language and caters to it. Someone who communicates by listening for discernment and understanding, not a comeback. This is very important..... Someone who does without having being told to do. Someone who is patient, understanding, and can bring a sense of calm to my maddening world..... The art of courtship has been lost and I am patient enough to wait until I find it or it finds me. My time is valuable. Literally every second of my days are accounted for so definitely someone who appreciates and respects my time.So basically, “The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you can find someone to love the you that you love, well, that's just fabulous.”P.S. I do not give out my number on this site. If you ask you are likely to not get a response, I prefer to meet in person after a few chats on here. Most men don't like this method to my madness and that is cool with me.... the right man won't mind (wink). Happy Fishing!"

Funny, I don't sit back and drink a beer after I vacuum and think - WOW, that looks nice. It just feels wonderful to be outside (when it is not 100 +). With that being said, I really enjoy going to the lake. The sound of the lake water hitting the bank is very relaxing. I do most of my workouts near the lake just for the sun / air / sounds. I can listen to most music (not rap or banging) but I mostly enjoy country music. I have not traveled much in my life but would love to now that I have more time. There are so many wonderful things that just need to be seen in person. I grew up going camping at the lake. I really miss that - not on the ground with snakes and such.If you are 5'5"" stop saying that you are 5'7"" or more.

I am looking to move back to SA soon and am currently in Converse while I Search for a place in SA. I'm not sure which area of San Antonio I want to settle in. I'm in sales management with a focus on interior design.  Returning to school is one of my goals. My other goal is to lose 45 lbs. I'm a thicker woman but am looking to trim down and be as fit as I was in my 20s and 30s. I am NOT skinny at this time and will never be skinny again lol I'm looking to be a size 10 and am currently a size 14/16. I want a toned, yet womanly and thick body. Healthy eating and exercising are focuses for me and I hope to find someone that would like to join me on this journey. I like going to the gym often and spending time there. I'm motivated to transform myself back into the way I was :-) I'm not looking to sacrifice gym time for anyone... It would be nice to have someone that likes it just as much.. Dancing and Zumba are two of my favorite pastimes. Music is a big love of mine. Some of my favorite genres are rock, pop, Reggaeton, bachata, Spanish rock, rap, and r&b. I'm interested in country and some jazz. I love live music and going to concerts is favorite pastime. Comedy shows are a must and I love watching movies. Cooking together is something I love to do as well :-)I support all Texas teams but my team will always be the Dallas Cowboys.  I got my passport in November because I want to truly start seeing the world :-)The latter part of 2017 and 2018 were very rough and challenging years...I'm very excited to start 2019 differently and to definitely make this the year of change. I'm very optimistic that I will achieve many of my goals and maintain my resolutions. I'm not perfect but I do try to be the best person I can. I have a strong work ethic and am ambitious. I'm responsible, committed, nurturing, faithful, very affectionate, very passionate, sweet, kind, soft spoken, and empathetic. I can be a fire cracker at times lol However, I'm not mean spirited and I don't like to hurt people. I truly believe in treating people how you want to be treated. I am a romantic spirit and am looking for someone that is just as romantic and passionate. I'm not interested in a relationship that becomes stagnant and complacent. A successful relationship for me requires strong communication and both people that love intimacy with each other. We should do what we can to keep the spark alive and the relationship fresh :-) I'm looking for someone SINGLE that is interested in friendship to start with a possibility of it turning into a long term relationship. I'm not looking for a relationship immediately. It takes time to get to know someone and click. Dating helps you see if there is potential for more. Please be affectionate, fun, loving, sweet, passionate, sexual, sensitive, honest, faithful, kind, open minded, and able to communicate. I'm interested in someone who is verbal and can carry on conversations on the phone and in person EVENTUALLY. Texting should not be the ONLY way to communicate please :-) Please love to smile and laugh."

509,MonarchBF,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"I was born in New York State, but I've been in Texas for just about as long as NY now. Does that make me a Texan? I've lived in all the big Texas cities...Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and of course here in Austin. I've loved them all for their own unique and special things. I still walk fast and talk fast and I love the NY Yankees - I have the Bronx in my blood. If you mix in a strong love for the quirky things about Texas, the hill country, small towns, country music, boots and wildflowers...that’s me I guess. ""I've been to hell and Texas, I know what its like to be riding that hot streak, and drunk on some back street..."" Well not literally. But, you get the drift. I've had my ups and downs. But I’m self-sufficient, have a job, a dog, own a house. I listen to Tanya Tucker, Steve Earle, Bruce, Willie, Guy, The Dixie Chicks, The Clash, GaGa, Ella, Pearl Jam and everything in between and around. I dream of traveling - road trips, day trips, any old trip even a head trip. It's what makes my heart beat fast and my smile wider. I'm pretty active. I have an active gym membership...meaning I actually go regularly and do stuff! I do a High Intensity Cardio/Weight training class 3/4x a week and I usually find other stuff to do throughout the week. I like to try new stuff. Being active is important to me. I've had my share of injuries...concussions, broken ribs...I fall off my bikes but I still ride 'em, even vacation with them. I like to cook! More than that - I love food shopping- grocery stores-I love them. There is nothing better to me than planning a meal and shopping for it! What can I say? The first time I walked into Central Market was pure JOY for me. Food makes me very happy. That's enough of me. The last thing I'll say for now is that I'm progressive with my politics. I’m looking for you because you are funny and smart and kind. You are ready to dance through life with a partner and a friend. You are looking for your next adventure with someone because while you could do it alone, you would much rather be with someone who is challenging, open, interesting and packs light....that part’s me. Try me out and find out. "

My friends are great but I'm looking to find that special someone to share life with. I'm not the bar hopper type so I thought this might be a good way to meet new people. I enjoy people with a quick witted sense of humor, an easy smile and a compassionate heart. I like to go out for a nice dinner but also enjoy quiet evenings at home cooking something delish and sharing a bottle of wine. I can cook most anything but creating meals together is the best, so extra points if you know your way around the grill! ;-) I do cardio exercise nearly every day and I'm looking for someone who also keeps himself in shape. No smokers, please. I don't seek perfection but hoping to find that special one who is perfect for me! I am debt, baggage and drama free! I hope you are, too. Finally, I do very much appreciate receiving the expressions of interest, but if I don’t respond it simply means I didn't see the potential for a connection. Best of luck with your pursuits. Cheers!"

During the week, I try to get some active time in after work, then chill. Once the weekend rolls around...it's on! I like well planned trips as much as on the fly ones. My favorite regular old Saturday is hiking early in the morning, then hitting a brewery in the afternoon. I’m also a total college football nut, whether it's going to games or just watching them with friends.I’m independent and looking for someone that I want in my life rather than someone I need.

558,stillwaiting4unow,F,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"FYI: Not interested in polyamory, those in ‘open’ & non-monogamous relationships, or pics of your body parts. If you are married, stay OUT of my inbox!! Oh, and I don’t want to date anyone who could be my dad or my son. Please adhere to (or stick close to) my age parameters. Because of the number of scammers, fake profiles, and married men on here, I’ll just cut to the chase. I know who I am & what I want, and I’ll wait for it for as long as necessary. I want the once in a lifetime type of love that takes my breath away. The one I ‘never saw coming’. A best friend/partner that I connect with on an ethereal level. I know he is out there. This just may not be the right venue or time. Your CURRENT (not past or projected) state: #1: you have TIME for a relationship. #2: You are ready to put EFFORT into a relationship. If you don’t meet #1 & 2, stop reading here & don’t waste my time. You: 5’8” or taller, physically fit, healthy, FUN, don’t take yourself too seriously, unselfish, HONEST (this starts with your profile, gentlemen!), respectful, empathic, emotionally & mentally intelligent, Romantic, passionate & financially stable. You listen to HEAR, not to answer. Reciprocity is a must: 100/100 ALWAYS. Me: 5’7(1/2)”. Educated, consistently employed, emotionally & mentally intelligent, romantic, kind, passionate, empathic and Spiritual. I wear my heart on my sleeve & will always be transparent. Stonewalling is a pet peeve. Communication should be open & honest, but always kind.... even when the conversation gets heavy. I have a diverse list of likes, including (but not limited to) billiards, hiking, fishing, wine, movies, music, arts, dancing & dining out. I grew up a tomboy and still don’t mind getting my hands dirty or playing in the mud, but I also like to dress up with heels for a night on the town. NO SMOKERS!!! NO MARRIED MEN!!If you're a hard core Trumpster, we probably won't get along. And for crying out loud, take off your sunglasses and SMILE so I can see your teeth (or if you even have them)! I do not have an upgraded account. If you’re interested then message me."

I'd like to live out my days with leisurely travels, exploring, .... but also doing something constructive. I never really want to retire all together. I enjoy fine dining and hole-in-the wall dives, visiting museums, going to local festivals, all kinds of sports like hiking, swimming, bicycling and dancing...but, I am also a home body and an introvert. I love quiet evenings home alone or with my companions, listening to music or reading, surfing the internet or watching videos or simply quietly sharing my space with another.Presently, for work, I clear and manage properties. I enjoy the physical labor and the sense of accomplishment I feel when turning a trashed property into something welcoming and valuable. Being healthy and active myself, I am looking for the same qualities in a man. Nice teeth are a real plus. I mean flossing is a real turn on.:-)I'm very curious and am always open to learning about new things. I'm a very good listener and love learning about other people's lives and adventures. I am also kind and empathetic. While I'm a passionate person and feel strongly about my own convictions, I'm sensitive to the beliefs of others and seek to find a middle ground. We're all unique with different life's experiences coloring who we are. My goal is to find where we agree instead of focusing on our differences. I make one important exception. If you're racist, please pass me by. I will never agree with you.And, music. It is ambrosia to the soul. I like all types of music. I love small-venue music clubs and even large concerts."

590,PrincipessaLisa,F,Graduate Degree,Caucasian,"I love life and am passionate about God, people, art, food, history, health, romance, and children. Mostly, I follow my own rules; breaking new ground and paving my own path; always looking for the opportunity to learn and grow. I don’t follow society or its social demands of each new and passing trend. My friends say my character is impeccable and my integrity is solid but trust me, I am far from perfect. I have many flaws but am committed to becoming all that God created me to be (sounds like an Army commercial LOL) Running is one of my favorite passions. When the day is over, it’s just me and the pavement for the next several miles; leaving the stress of life behind me.I honestly believe that making a difference in someone's life is far more important than any title, salary or degree so I don’t care how many letters come at the end of your signature. Caring and giving to others bring true joy to my soul. My heart is especially drawn to children; abused and neglected and I want to travel the world loving them and feeding them with the word of God. My friends consider me to be creative, very resilient, a survivor and one who views the glass as half full rather than half empty. At times I am impulsive, and I find much excitement in creating romantic spontaneous adventures. I would much rather be outdoors with the warmth of the sun on my face so in my leisure time you can usually find me exploring this wonderful world we live in. On the serious side I am very traditional, loyal, loving, kind, and attentive. I have seen much tragedy tramway and devastation first hand which gives me an appreciation for life and how precious it really is.My relationship with Christ and living each day to honor him is the most important thing in my life. I am only interested in being a life partner (that means marriage), not a temporary position in a man's world. This is the only area that is not flexible for me. My hope and prayer is that the Lord will bless me with the man I desire…. One is uncompromising and compliments my walk with Him. I appreciate romance and chivalry and prefer spending time with an intelligent, refined gentleman who has passion in his eyes, leadership in his walk, and tenderness in his hand. I find myself drawn to gentlemen who are respectful, kind, compassionate, affectionate, and giving from their heart. I am looking forward to spending time with you; exploring this beautiful and marvelous thing we call LIFE."

Things I like to do:Tubing down the Guadalupe River, boating on Canyon Lake, snorkeling in the Caribbean. Spontaneous drives, exploring little Texas hill Country towns. Seeing the latest movie. Learning new things. Backyard barbecues.Recent books:I mostly read to expand my horizons and challenge my own thinking. Occupation:I sell large scale commercial solutions for a major audio video integrator.What am I looking for?I'm looking for an incredible woman! Haha! Nobody's perfect - I certainly know I have a few little quirks. You gotta be able to laugh and like to have fun! Yes, I can be serious. Would you be okay getting together with some new circles of friends? I have quite a few friends in several intermingled circles or groups. I am looking for a friendship that evolves into a stronger relationship. Honesty and communication is important - along with a sweet and loving personality! I am enjoying life in this great state of Texas and it would be nice to have someone to enjoy it with! "

628,austinguy4444,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"*I come with 2 girls aged 9 and 6 and I’m not a weekend dad. *Well. Here I am. On POF.com. What a long, amazing road its been. I had it with the dating apps, complained to unknown numbers of strangers that the apps were shallow and ruining the whole human interaction thing...and what did I do to stand up for principles and my experiences? Solved it with another dating app. Yeah, let’s do that. Smart man. Then again, I did learn a lot. Heck, just a few days ago I went on the worst date of my whole life. I’ll spare you the details but I’ll share that lies are a terrible way to gain the affection of this man.Yes, the dating apps molded me, shaped me and taught me exactly what I didn’t want. They taught me that I too can feel bad about myself if I don’t have a standard and boundaries. They taught me that I am not in competition with any male. I’m just searching for something I lack. I don’t need or want any woman. I want the right woman. I don’t care what you look like. I care who you are. I don’t need companionship. I want a friend. I’m not desperate. I simply want someone to love that loves me back. I don’t want to go on dates. I want to spend my time with someone I like being around.I could continue that list on and on but I think you want to know about who I am. What to say? Should I write words to woo you? Or say things you want to hear? Ugh. How about some truth? Then maybe you can deduce who I am...I know you wonderful people are walking BS detectors. I’m divorced because we never should have gotten married just because we had a kid. We tried to make it work for 10 years cause that’s what you do, right? Terrible choice. We simply should never have gone that way. But now we are all happier. I believe the father is the most lacking thing our values have forgotten. Just about every statistic about crime or education or single moms involves the lack of committed dads. I believe in talking it out. I don’t need to change you, future companion. I do know how to be introspective and share my feelings. Some of my brothers can’t do that and I’m sorry for them. One of my strengths is being able to detect something needs to be talked about and not solved. That venting and talking is just about the most relaxing thing here is. Almost. I’m a super engaged dad. My kids are homeschooled. No, you don’t need to change anything for me/us. I got this. Just know I value the freedom of being able to teach my kids and give them a gift very few of us get. No, homeschool is not better - just better for us. To each their own. I am an introvert. No, it doesn’t mean I can’t stare longingly into your eyes or push up my glasses (none) with my finger or can’t confront someone that needs to be checked. It means simply that I recharge my social batteries by quiet and calm, by being around the familiar and safe. I can act like any extrovert for a time but it’s exhausting. Fellow introverts know what’s up. I want to give to you so much I can’t stand it. I want to support you 150%. When you are busy I want to run your errands. When you are sick I want to do everything to serve you. When we need time to ourselves I want to shield us. When you are growing I want to lift you up. However, I want you to do the same. I want unconditional support and to give it as well. Every relationship I’ve ever been in has taught me - THAT is the way. I can feel it. Exactly what good friends do. Can we strive for that? Fantastic. Well, that’s my spiel."

Local San Antonio area only, but I do look forward to travel with you ;-)I'm a good mix of old fashioned romantic values with a modern spirit and excitement for love. Searching for that mutual sparkle in each other's eye and burning passion in each other's heart that builds into a lasting romantic relationship. I like to feel passion in a relationship and I'm looking for someone who is comfortable giving and receiving affectionI'm single with no drama or connections to past relationships. I'm an optimistic guy with a positive outlook on life and I see a world of opportunities open for the future and looking for someone to share in the joy of life and a romantic relationship. I'm not rushing to find a wife, but I am looking for a long term committed romantic relationship and open to marriage again should the sparks fly and continue to flourish between us.I like live music events, dancing, and a fun night on the town; but just as comfortable with a nice dinner and movie night, or a relaxing evening at home. When dining out I like to enjoy a glass of wine or two (generally Cabernet, but open to all good wine), or a beer (Corona, or Budweiser), or mixed drink or two (vodka and cranberry favorite)...depending the dinner and environment. I mostly listen to classic rock-n-roll. On the radio my favorite stations are 99.5, 102.7, and some 105.3; although I appreciate good country and TexMex music given the company and environment. I'm eager to travel near and far with the right partner (passport ready).Born and raised in San Antonio (McCollum High School), now living on the NE side. UTSA graduate. Retired Air Force Major and my job after the AF has been leading software engineering projects, so in that regards I'm techie; but that's my work personality. My off work personality a relaxed and easy-going personality. I'm not a needy or clingy person. I'm an even tempered guy, never quick to anger.Some of my past, that's in my past...17-year marriage ended with her passing, followed by a 2.5-year marriage that ended in a mutual, no drama, uncontested divorce I initiated. I have no living children. I was the primary care giver since birth to my only son who was disabled and passed away at 19 years old.I'm optimistic with a positive outlook and a world of opportunities open for the future for us to enjoy together!"

661,Atlas_Shrugging,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"The Laws of Physics do not apply to me. I am respected by animals, children, and clergy. I invented the Internet. I designed the layout for Green Dolphin Street on the back of a****ail napkin while dictating the great American novel to my younger brother, who I'll call Hewson. I once taught a platoon of infantrymen to recite by heart poems by Walt Whitman without so much as moving their lips. Many of my peers know me only by the name “Satchmo” and will swear up and down that I am a real stand up kind of guy. I voted for Bush….twice. (I'm a Libertarian that votes occasionally R, and I did not vote for Trump...or Hillary for that matter) I pass my days making dolls for children in Africa and memorizing quotes from Victorian literature. I knit all my own socks. I coined the phrase, *It s all good* in 1987 in order to cope with the loss of my second true love (and never looked back.) I have thirteen diplomas, twelve of them honorary. Residents of Prague and Lima look to me as a pillar of strength and hygiene. I am two degrees from Kevin Bacon (two different ways), unaffected by weather, and can tell a person's eye color by talking to them on the telephone. I let the dogs out. OK, on the serious side...I'm a fairly intelligent, above average looking, slightly overworked guy. I'm looking here because it seems I never have enough time and for once I thought I'd let technology work for me instead of the other way around. I like being outdoors, whether it's on my bike or on the golf course. Live music is one of my passions; otherwise, you can find me hanging out with my friends, playing pool, throwing darts, making fun of each other, etc. I'm looking for a woman who is funny, smart, ambitious, responsible, confident, physically and emotionally healthy, happy with herself most of the time, and sweet...not necessarily in that order, a woman who's insightful and willing to fight for what she believes in, someone I can respect and always count on to do what she says. It's important to me that a woman has a handle on who she is and what she wants in life. A woman who can challenge me intellectually and make me laugh is extremely important (Is there any way to underline that in BOLD type?). Great chemistry is very important to me too - attractiveness is really only one small factor in that equation. I'm not looking for someone to make me happy or complete me...I am happy, and pretty much have all my ____ together. I'm looking for the icing on the cake. If you suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome (Don't blame me, I voted for Gary Johnson) please move on...nothing to see here.P.S. - If you don't look like your profile, you have to buy me drinks until you do...P.P.S.

I'm looking for someone who is emotionally and mentally stable, we all come with some sort of issue so if you think you're perfect please move on. Also I'm looking for someone who is looking for a relationship and not someone who wants a body around them. If you dont understand that difference please move on. I don't want to be categorized in the same sentence on the men who causes you harm. I'M NOT THEM, also since this is out of the way. Here's a bit about me. I'm single and have been. Just recently started looking for someone and with that being said I'm not perfect. I have a daughter who is 4 and she is my time and energy.

703,waveman86,M,Graduate Degree,Caucasian,"Suffice it to say I value emotional intelligence above all else. But...* The last great book I read: yeah, right. here's the laundry list...-homage to catalonia- george orwell-talks with a devil: p.d. ouspensky-the empty mirror: janwillem van de wetering-bliss(this one reminds me of my own life), illywhacker, the tax inspector -peter carey-the songlines -bruce chatwin-the seven pillars of wisdom -t.e. lawrence-love in the time of cholera -marquez-wind, sand and stars -antoine de saint-exupery-islands in the stream - hemingway (yes, it is great.)-all the king's men- robert penn warren-the 47th franz kafka -rudy rucker-the artificial kid -bruce sterling-the short-timers -gustav hasford-a brief history of time -stephen hawking-hero with a thousand faces -joseph campbell-the dictionary (no, not the whole thing.)yup. i read honest-to-god, real books. they're like food for my brain.* My most humbling moment:this should be moments because a couple come to mind. moving up to dallas for the software start-up i worked for, only to watch it all go ker-blooey when the boom was over. stuck in big d without a job and no way to get back to austin. boy, did i feel like an organ-grinder's monkey. another time, while skydiving over the florida everglades, as i was hurtling towards the earth i thought of a bug hitting a windshield and that if i bounced, no one would know the difference. between me and the squashed bug, that is. obviously, i made it in one piece.* Favorite on-screen sex scene:reclining nude by amedeo modigliani.* The celebrity I resemble the most:pffft! who cares?* The best or worst lie I've ever told:i try not to lie because it always embarrasses me. there's nothing altruistic about that, it's just that i hate being embarrassed.* If I could be anywhere right now:hmmm. sitting in front of my computer writing an online dating profile? no, that should probably be under my most humbling moment. hey, how about waking up on a rainy morning with the woman i love sleeping next to me! yeah, i know. we haven't had too many rainy mornings here lately.* Five items I can't live without:not really items but: change, family, friends, my dog, water (in it, on it, near it, drinking it), coffee, cream for my coffee, my bike, music, books, music, love. did i mention music? i know that's more than five but limits are for losers.* Fill in the blank: a)_____ is sexy; b)_____ is sexier. a) lingering eye contact- b) a feral leer-* In my bedroom one will find:a bed. books and a reading lamp on a nightstand. warm winter sunlight streaming through my bedroom window. wood floors. more often than not, chili (my dog) sleeping in a corner. clothes. chaos. bliss.Why You Should Get to Know Me:i moved back to austin a few years ago after a three-year hiatus in hell, otherwise known as dull-ass, texas, chasing the big yankee dollar. so i realize that there is a lot more to life than money. although i live in central east austin and love it here, i'm pretty outdoors-y. i hike, take epic walks with my dog and cycle avidly (and no, i do not wear spandex OR an ironic beard or mustache. i just ride.), but doing so without someone special to share it with can be a wee bit boring. all my friends have gotten married/had kids and/or moved to the suburbs and i've been busy with work and all blah blah blah so haven't had many opportunities to meet anyone new but i wanna take time for that now. every day i explore and re-discover all that austin has to offer but i'd like to do this with someone who has similar but different perspectives from my own. you know, the feminine perspective? this kind of thing is always more fun when you see it through the eyes of someone you care about. i'm passionate, kind, and devoted with/to them whose presence i value. i'm creative as heck and somehow manage to maintain a childlike outlook on life. not childish, childlike. i'm irreverent and silly, a daredevil and a knucklehead. a former bad boy now reformed. driven. brilliant but diffuse. typing frustrates me. I prefer writing with pencils to writing with pens. I love music and make up and sing songs about my dog. also, i have radar in my heart, and when i open my eyes... i become the world. oh yeah... i'm an outstanding cook with the right company, and i'm tired of making coffee for one. and believe it or not, i'm not very good at talking about myself.More About What I Am Looking For:how about a cute, sweet librarian type with a punk rock attitude. no? okay, so how about this... synchrony. serendipity. a source of inspiration. collaboration. mutual admiration. someone who would never confuse kindness with weakness, who gives as good as she gets, who can grasp what the kingdom of the mind is. someone with depth, balance, humor. kindness and curiosity. independent and intelligent. my best friend. someone to learn from and share with. who talks with her hands, who is strong enough to know that she doesn't have to prove it. someone to read with. somebody fun to go to hole-in-the-wall restaurants with, who enjoys an occasional night out on the town having a beer or a glass of wine, playing (ms.) pac-man, learning to two-step at the white horse or the spoke, watching a band play or whatever. a teammate for the kitchen, who knows what rainy weekends are good for. someone who enjoys spur of the moment road trips to the coast or the hill country and exploring funky towns thereabouts. exploring and discovery are VERY key words here. It's all about what's over the horizon.if i haven't replied to your inquiries in a timely manner, thank you for your patience. but please note: it's highly unlikely that i'm going to reply to a one or two-word email, like ""hey"" or ""hi there"" or whatnot. those only suggest a lack of any real interest, curiosity, intellect, or all three. don't be shy. if you saw something in my profile that you like, say something. sorry for the rant and thank you for reading."

I also like to travel throughout Texas and abroad (warmer climates only).I don't smoke, use illicit substances, lay in the gutter with alcohol nor will I tolerate those habits in the person I'm looking for in life.

A lot of women on here say they Want to get Married but how you want to get Married and you haven't hung out with the person? Hell I can say I want to get married or say I seriously want to date but All that comes with a process.

So watch what you ask for ladies??

If flowers come back every year, I care for them then think of how I will make you grow in love and the end result is always beauty and happiness. I like to throw in. Pictures dont do justice. It's real life that's shows how handsome or beautiful you are. No matter how much you pose for pics nothing seems to compare to real life. You will always look better when you meet than a picture. I will tell you I like trailing and mountains. Wether it is driving or riding a bike or walking. I like swimming in the rivers and camping. I'm not afraid of bears as I will protect you. I have encountered bears before and know what to do. Remember I am a native American. Please don't mind my hair it has always been long but I always keep it nice and has never been discrimination especially the job I do (purchasing). I love to dance. At the end of the night you come to a place called home.I would like to travel more often.I am a good singer and have old songs that have made through out my life.I like to dress nice even if it's just going to the store. Always clean shaved and well groomed.Honest, active such as bike riding, walking, hiking and site seeing. Loves to laugh and likes to have fun.

I love me some home cook meals, and get by with my small kitchen. It will be nice to meet someone who is down to tackle a nice dinner once a week, talk and listen to music. It sounds like a date every week, now it sounds exhausting(open to suggestions). I work nights, and currently have a lot of free time on my hands, but once this ball gets rolling I’ll probably be a busy bird “idk if that’s an idiom but going to use it anyway” so the game plan is to be a family man. What I need is a sportive woman that will keep me in line in my squirrel moments, happy where she is and where she is going. If you have a kid I’m cool with that, but I don’t do more than 1 baby daddy. I have my limits, and not trying to be in any drama. Let’s just proceed pass this. I’m a thinker slash listener, talking isn’t my strong suit, I’ll get exhausted thinking of things to talk about and start to feel awkward if you don’t seem interested in any of it.

And just like you.....I'm looking for someone just like you're looking for....someone easy to laugh with, easy to be yourself with, someone easy to talk with--and be silent with, someone almost easier to be with -than without. Ok...right off gotta say... I'm kind of liveaholic...I have to live a little every day.Works good-- but funs better. I am a guy..but didn't inherit the watch sports all day gene. I can put up the occasional cowboys or spurs game on TV--but would rather be on the 50 at a local HS game, soccer match, missions baseball, playing touch football w/ you in the backyard, or trying our best to get a DUI on a golfcart---I don't do golf either but wrecking a golf cart might be fun.*Normal manly things do appeal to me....working out, swimming (fluorescent speedos!), action movies---comedies are better...I just gotta see that smile! But some girly things too...manicures, pedicures (yes they do make Black n Decker nail files), massages....just don't ask to borrow my bubble bath. I don't even mind if you want me to go shopping with you for a while. No, I'm kidding. Ok I will... wait...(btw...jk about the speedos--they're not fluorescent silly)  What am I looking for?....the whole thing ..friendship, good times, companionship, affection, passion, kindness, partnership, even bad times --hopefully, always..right beside each other.so...to re-cap:You are a go out and do lady...You love people, people watchingYou're happy--and want others around you to be happyYou like good conversation..sarcasmYou're spontaneous. You love to get crazy on some kind of regular basis. You're witty, confidentYou're alive..and you realized it right when you woke up.You play a decent game of Scrabble . You like being a big part of the relationship you're inYou have a relationship with your creator--first names!You like to help people. But make fun of some too.You're once, twice, three times a lady?

778,Rhetorion,M,Associates Degree,Caucasian,"Enjoy sports and being outdoors around the water going boating, canoing, fishing, etc (even if nothing is biting, its still an enjoyable peaceful escape). Would like to get into scuba and snorkeling someday and perhaps some saltwater/deepsea fishing on the coast.Also like to spend time shooting pool and darts, bowling, playing cards and boardgames, the occassional video game, and things of that sort. Getting together and grilling and enjoying drinks and spending the evening relaxing lounging outside or sinking into the sofa and putting in a movie always counts as a good time.Don't really do a whole lot of things at the moment which keeps my life simple right now, but the saying ""... try something atleast once ..."" holds true. That holds especially true for sushi; never imagined it would find its way into my belly and now I savor ever time I get some. Not sure how I endured and survived upstate new york and its winters without sonic limeades, whataburger, chicken express, and taco cabana. Love greek food as well.Try to wear a cowboys or longhorns t-shirt from time to time to camouflage being a red sox and patriots fan (survival instinct kicking in there). Being born in SA, I do route for the Spurs.I'm pretty easy going and laid back, super shy, and quick to laugh. Good at listening and observing and tend to do it all the time.A couple sayings I tend to adhere too are ""Do what you can with what you got"" and ""God is in the detail"" (Mies van der Rohe). The little things, the minor details, and obscure nuances are what matter and make a difference for me in the long run.Oh and so yeah - Dave Matthews Band - yeah DMB pretty much heh. I like listening to alot of other music but DMB is really the only one that I pay attention to the song names and lyrics.Probably the most important qualities I'm looking for out there are kindness, honesty, sincerity, trust and loyalty. I don't have any tolerance for hypocrits, rudeness, liars, cheats, egotists, judgementalists, conflict seekers, and drama-llamas (drama does happen unfortunately to all of us, but I'm not interested in it 24/7).

I'm self-employed and self motivated. I'm interested in a caring relationship with a kind and considerate person. Honesty and integrity are important as well as the ability to communicate openly and freely. It is important that we have some things in common. I am looking for someone who can carry on an intellectual conversation and who is well spoken as well as a sense of humor. I like animals and being outdoors as well as the coziness of friends and good conversation. The ocean and beaches have always been an important part of my life. I love going out for dinners as well as cooking for guests, cooking for myself. I've decided it's time to enjoy life a lot more. My goal is to find someone special. I have a great career. I don't have time or any interest in drama or adding stress to my life. I want to do things, different things whether I end up liking them or not. While I wear a suit and tie to work I'm really much more comfortable in my old jeans. I was recently informed that I had failed this section to state who I'm looking for. Perhaps it's because I'm not sure how to describe her. I have no idea what hair color she'll have or what her height will be. Not sure if it matters if her favorite food is Sushi or if she prefers Italian restaurants or if she likes beaches more than the mountains. However, I know she'll be a good person who is kind and thoughtful toward others. She smiles a lot. She likes to laugh a lot! She doesn't have to be a athlete but she takes care of herself and is health conscious. I'd like someone who is sharp witty but who also has a fun and silly side. But ultimately, it will be more about how she makes me feel than what she looks like or what her favorite hobby is. I really wish to find a woman to spend the rest of my life with. Which me luck everyone has i which you the same."

Spurs Fan without question.I have 2 kids that live with me full time. One of which is 15 and my little one is going on 8. They are becoming a little more self efficient, so it gives me time to get out a little bit and test the waters.My oldest and I have gone to the monster truck shows for the past decade, and will continue to do so. Its become a tradition you could say. I play tennis year round, in league's and in tournament's in and around the city. I'm very passionate about the game, I started playing when I was about 12 years old. I read books about financial freedom. (i.e. Dave Ramsey, Tony Robbins, Suze Orman). One goal of mine is to have financial peace, it is an everyday struggle, but I won't stop until I've reached that peace. I don't compare myself to others. I just continue to be the best version of myself everyday I'm givin to do so. I listen to a variety of music, Rock-n-roll, spanish, rap, hip-hop, love songs, a little raegae, country. I haven't learned to 2 step however. Always willing to try new things never the less. I really like comedy shows, I've attened appearances by Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Joey Diaz. Joe Rogan, Gary Owen to name a few. As my kids get older would defintely like to travel. We've been to a couple of places, like Florida, Carloina, California, Las Vegas.. Lol.. Well Las Vegas was with some friends.I don't smoke and only drink socially, however I haven't socialized much lately. hope to hear from you and if not, good luck to you on your venture."

You should know that because of the number of scammers, fake profiles, the crazies on here. I’ll just cut to the chase, and say that I am definitely not interested in being one of many. Add to that, because I mention my current state/condition, women think I too am a scammer. funny!!!Fact is, I am not seeking anyone's pity or sympathy. And because I have always been that kind of male who has a problem taking money from women. Any you have is safe from me. SERIOUSLY!!!!"

If you don't know what the business is try me, you will surely find out. I am not on this site to play games. Let's be adults and be honest. If you don't like what you see, I'm fine with that. Just keep on fishing but not in my ocean. Bless you and enjoy your time on this site. I want to add this. Iam not a skinny man I am muscular and thick. My arms, chest and entire body are real. No photo shopping here. I am all natural. If this is not for you please stop leaving message asking me questions about my body. I AM REALLY THIS BIG!!!! Omg. Reading.,writing, workin out."
821,AlphaMaleDavid,M,Associates Degree,Hispanic,"I am a Christian man who is old fashioned and has conservative, traditional beliefs and viewpoints. Liberals and I don't get along. If you only have face pictures I'm not going to respond, I keep getting tricked by profiles that read average, athletic, slender etc... And then find out I was lied to. Please be honest! Everything in my profile is the truth and really don't appreciate the dishonesty. This also applies to only one profile pictures. 8 times out of 10 they are fake profiles with stolen images. And yes, I'm quickly losing interest in this site because of it.I am not a boy, and don't play games, when it comes to my heart or yours. If you've ever seen classic films or John Wayne movies, then you know what you're getting into here. I believe that a man should be a man, and a woman should be completely girly. I don't subscribe to the concept of any other types of genders. I respect mothers who raised girls to be women, If you believe or were raised to treat your man right, then I'm the man who will treat you like a Queen. I won't kiss your a$$, and I am honest to a fault. I have been off the market and have become the man God wants me to be. I am not politically correct, I am a Christ follower and I am not perfect. I am however still working on this. When I'm in a relationship, I believe that I am property of my woman and she is mine. You get extra points if you enoy wearing skirts and dresses, enjoy rom-coms and are affectionate. I am very affectionate and love to hold the woman who holds my heart. I'm not looking for ""Hot"" or ""Sexy"" (too much psycho and drama there) I want a cute face, a slender, voluptuous or average figure that keeps my interest and my hands on you whenever you walk by. Each of my past relationships, have made me a better person and taught me how to cherish the woman I'm with. I'm open to meet, and if there's a spark of interest and chemistry, we can start as friends, then see if we mutually want to take it beyond that. I am witty, sarcastic and cheeky, so you can't be overly sensitive to jokes. I love hearing the laughter of the woman I love, and really am attracted to the sound of a woman's voice, playfulness, and sexiness. Lastly, If you need an ""outdoor"" guy, that's not me. I enjoy technology and the benefits of today's modern age. I love relaxing to Country Music, Smooth Jazz, Instrumental soundtracks, Classical, and Christian music (KLOVE). I read my Bible every morning and am starting my 4th re-read of old and new testament. If you've ever watched Little House on the Prairie, then You can grasp my faith lifestyle. It's similar to Charles Ingles.I have noticed that women tend to prefer men of a certain height, so I respect that. Just as we men tend to prefer women of a certain weight, so please respect that. I wish you well and thank you for reading this far. Feel free to send a message if any of this speaks to you."

841,luv4you74,M,Some University,Caucasian,"I've been on this site for some time now ( less than 1 year) and I feel that people misjudge or label you before even meeting you. Not everyone is photogenic. That does not necessarily mean you will look exactly as in your pics. Yes, you will have most of the features and IT WILL be you but for some of us, photos don't do us real justice. I'm an example of that and I have been told many times I need to get rid of my pics because they don't really represent the real me or do a poor job representing me. So, having this said, if you come across my profile or I have reached out to you, give yourself the chance to really see the real me and not just "" Unread delete"" I get it, is all about attraction as well and we will never be always attracted to everyone. If you are in doubt, then meet the real me and decide. The worst than can happen is you made a new friend. ABOUT ME:Im a father of 3 loving kiddos ages 10, 7 and 6 ( Boy, girl, boy). They are my life and priority. I'm very active and love to work out. I actually run and lift weights everyday. I used to compete in Jiu jitsu but life took over and my kids soccer schedule got in the way. I'm a very genuine, romantic, sentimental and affectionate man. I'm very nostalgic and caring. I'm very outgoing and spontaneous. I love to surprise and love details. I can tell if we are on a good path once we meet. It's all about a solid connection and chemistry. If you are really looking for someone caring and real, give yourself a chance to meet me and I'm sure I won't disappoint. I wish you the best in your search!"

917,AustinWeird74,M,Associates Degree,Caucasian,"First of all, I love to laugh and am a bit silly at times, so I def. need someone with a sense of humor ;) Life is already stressful enough, so you should just have fun everyday and not take things so seriously, learn to enjoy the things most take for granted. Take the time to talk with family and friends and really listen and be present. I am very close to my family and they take priority in my life. I would like to meet somone who feels the same and would treat me with that same respect and appreciation. The person I am supposed to end up with will be my best friend and confidant. Someone who I could talk to about anything and she would understand and actually listen. She is someone I can have great conversations with and who is intelligent enough to have one. I also plan to travel more in the future to be able see and experience different things. I always keep an open mind and am usually up for doing something new,different and exciting! I'm down to earth, and tend to appreciate even the smallest of things...they usually are a good indication of someone's true character."

I rarely sit still for long.Speaking of which, I have custody of the boys 50% of the time, so a timing can be a little weird sometimes.

I'll have to let you be the judge :)Oh... I am a voracious reader of fiction/non-fiction, always on the hunt for a spectacular story, or story of a life. I exercise often, as it is my daily catharsis. I love to try new restaurants, unique bars, travel, spontaneous stuff (get me out of my comfort zone).

Over the years I've realized it's not necessarily about the NEED, but the WANT. Don't have a particular type that I'm looking for. All that I ask is that you be willing to work towards something significant"
967,DavidSuccess2k,M,Masters Degree,Caucasian,"The profile is long. It's fine if you don't relate to any or all of it and don't favorite me or contact me. That's the idea of a profile. All my friends are really interesting people. I've had my share of relationships and I've gained and learned from all of them. Even negative experiences contain valuable lessons. I decided to give POF a try for interesting people. In a study, there are 3 questions that create a high correlation between people and their success as a couple:1. “Do you like scary movies?” (No, The Shining is about my limit.)2. “Have you ever traveled to another country alone?” (Yes, multiple times.)3. “Would you like to ditch it all and go live on a sailboat?” (Sure, why not. This also applies to ditching everything, getting a very nice RV and seeing North America.)4. (This one is mine from personal experience) No psychologists. I've never met a sane one, after all, what is sane? But the last one I met must have been off her meds for a very long time. LOL.If you don't match those then please look elsewhere. You're doing us both a favor, and thank you. If you do match then I appreciate your time reading the rest of this.Oh...and one more. You need a College Degree and not just from the School of Hard Knocks as we all graduated from there and still take remote courses. Master Degrees and multiple Master's or a PhD go to the top of the list. Experience counts as well, as does running your own business for a number of years. I don't care about your money and you better not care about mine but I am concerned about the brain I'm going to be around for the rest of my life and you should be the same. Ever played Codenames? I make time for the things I want to do and share, and for the important people in my life.In a relationship I am looking for:The ability to discuss issues with intelligence and facts instead of emotion and warrantless assertions. Great experiences with one another. Educations in life or in school or both. A love of travel and adventure for the new and personally undiscovered. A love for passion in many things and sharing to continue to have a joyful and meaningful life!Being right can be important in work, but in personal relationships, the ability to be kind, forgiving and caring of the other person in a relationship is important...really important. Being negative is just a drag. PDA and touching are just fine too.If your tack smart then you're confident and funny. You can laugh at yourself and almost everything in life. You appreciate a subtle pun when you hear it, and fart jokes are still funny. You also respect a wonderful $18.34 bottle of cab, a $7.54 bottle of some great blend from the HEB as well as some wonderful mixologist's efforts at an old rustic hotel bar in Santa Fe. You'll tolerate me getting a 5-guys burger wrapped in lettuce (or maybe we'll get two!) and then recommend some excellent undiscovered restaurant where we can talk about life and laugh the evening away. If god or God is important in your life then so be it, but it's not in mine. I am an ordained minister in The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (I paid for the certificate to prove it as well). I'm a poorly-practicing Buddhist (new land sect), and if I was to convert I'd go Jewish as they have great parties, more holidays, and none of the Jesus and Hell stuff. I get spiritual, I get nature and the grandness of things - it is amazing.If you're a Trump supporter then seek counseling. I'm likely a raging liberal business person (self-employed for 16 years) that sees the emperor's clothes of trickle-down economics. If you want to really stimulate the economy you have to give people the ability to spend money (that whole velocity of money is true). Lowering taxes does not create jobs. I'm also back in the IT world with a great job that takes up a lot of time.I can leave a lot behind but I can't part with truth....And that's the only thing I need is *this*. I don't need this or this. Just this ashtray... And this paddle game. - The ashtray and the paddle game and that's all I need... And this remote control. - The ashtray, the paddle game, and the remote control, and that's all I need... And these matches. - The ashtray, and these matches, and the remote control, and the paddle ball... And this lamp. - The ashtray, this paddle game, and the remote control, and the lamp, and that's all *I* need. And that's *all* I need too. I don't need one other thing, not one... I need this. - The paddle game and the chair, and the remote control, and the matches for sure. Well, what are you looking at? What do you think I'm some kind of a jerk or something! - And this. That's all I need.Things I don't like:Popping gum. Talking with food in your mouth.Bad personal hygiene.Negativity...as being positive and having a good lookout is beautiful.For me, If life gives you lemons, you make lemon propelled grenades and lemon juice powered flamethrowers.You're still cool if you're a bit late. You can plan something and then throw it all away to do something else you think is better.As for music, I will listen to almost everything once. Pop country isn't really my thing nor is much rap. However, I'm a fan of The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron, LKJ and some others. Old country and Americana is great. I still buy CDs and recently pick up the latest from TuneYards and Sara Bareilles. There is a massive vinyl collection in storage (lots of Jazz), plus I was involved in sound production and radio for many years.Much of life makes me laugh, but some of it makes me cry. Rick and Morty make me laugh as does Felix the Cat, Dave Chappelle, and Maria Bamford. If I can stay up that late I love catching Colbert's monologues. Patton Oswalt and Temple Grandin both make me laugh and cry.There is SO MUCH to go do and so little time.Passion, intelligence, being perceptive, optimistic and a wicked sense of humor are a few ways to describe me. I hope they mostly describe you.Maybe you can be an enthusiastic and great partner in crime! Cheers and good luck."

973,RLH2068,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"I'm 5'11"", shaved head, brown eyes, and fit. I have a great job, take my job and career very seriously, get great satisfaction from it, but I do not live to work. Health and fitness are very important to me. I tend to work out as often as my schedule will permit. On the weekends I like to go out (dinner, drinks, movies, live music, sporting events), but I also like to stay in (watch TV or a movie) and hang out on the couch. I have a passion for cars and spend some time playing with them.I am looking for someone to have fun with that will hopefully lead to a serious/long term relationship. This online dating thing is a little different. From experience I have found it does not make much sense to email back and forth for weeks without meeting the other person. So many times I have gotten to know a very nice person only to find that there is absolutely no chemistry. Also, I will not communicate with members who have not posted pictures.My ideal mate is attractive (yes, it's important - that being said, beauty is in the eye of the beholder), fit, intelligent, and hard working. She is my best friend. She is caring, compassionate, and empathetic. She is passionate and affectionate. She communicates well. She likes fine dining and greasy spoons. She likes getting dressed up and likes hanging out in a t-shirt and ball cap. She is refined - I can take her to work functions, and she is laid back - likes to listen to live music. She likes sports, UFC (I know, it's a stretch), cars, animals, etc. She is neat and organized. One of my favorite quotes is:Immature love says ""I love you because I need you.""Mature love says ""I need you because I love you."""

980,Nati0nalHunk,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"Hi! Just looking for one special lady to become my best friend. Not looking for a penpal. No intention of staying on POF after making a real connection. I have a 10yr old that is the center of my world. As a single parent with a full time job & a student, free time is limited for a little while longer, but I can & will make time...Travel is my greatest passion, have done a lot, and I hope to do a lot more. Was a vegetarian for a long time but now eat Paleo-ish. Exercise & a healthy lifestyle are crucial to powering my world. Hopefully, you feel the same... I'm a tech & music nerd w/ NPR or Podcasts competing for my ears when the music stops. Not one for TV, but I do like Netflix, series binges, etc. I have a relationship w/ God but not church. If abstaining from symbolic rituals is a deal breaker, I understandNo pix older than 1.5 yrs btw... and I should add that the height of a woman means very little to me. Tall prospects needn't worry as I've earned my man card many times over. There are no questions hereThanks for looking and good luck to us all in our search! PS. Paying for PoF is like taking a lunch box to a buffet. Please message me if you're configured to only receive messages from the $10 a mo. club"

988,true_values,M,Associates Degree,Hispanic,"Hello,Let me begin by stating, that by all means I'm not a perfect man because we're all human and we all make mistakes. We as human beings have different likes and dislikes as well as different expectations of each other. I believe where there's lack of communications a relationship fails. I believe that in a relationship both parties need to be good listeners, communicate better and express our likes /dislike as well as our expectations very clearly. Many times in a relationship we fail to communicate or our true feelings therefore misunderstanding occur, our partner get hurt not intentionally but because none of us are capable of reading the other's mind. The failure to communicate is clearly the reason of hurt feelings. I also, believe that the key to a healthy relationship is putting our partner's feeling first above all else. We need to be aware on how we say things to the one we love and learn to interact better. I consider myself a caring, loving, loyal, honest and faithful man. If you're looking for a good man then look no further. I've had the same job for the last 30 years. I'm committed to my job like I'm committed to my relationship. I'm a one woman man. If you treat me good, I promise you that I will treat you 10 times better. "

991,gittinbald,M,Some college,Caucasian,"Is this our year for a keeper?Hi, thank you for coming to the water,  If you enjoy being respected and treated as a lady, having doors opened for you, like flowers as pleasant surprises, enjoy holding hands in public; knowing that you are special, maybe we should talk. I strive for honesty and well-being to others.  I consider myself carrying a few extra pounds (was corrected by a nice compliment) comes from the fact that I cook rather well and not just the Texas favorite-BBQ. Hmm okay, being single I have developed some poor habits too, sorry not perfect. Qualities :) Not bad with construction repairs/skills and I do well with mechanical repairs (my vehicles are older because I can repair them). Now gardening, landscape maintenance is okay, but my green thumb keeps turning brown. Golf is an activity/social events that keeps me additionally active. Used to, I was exposed to farm/ranch life, did my share of riding horses and working cattle and was in the middle of numerous other country animals-some of the best of times of life. Maybe I should mention water activities, since I grew up in the coastal region fishing, skiing, swimming and lots of beach time. Getting out and exploring Texas for a trip or a festival is a great day. Going to an opera, play or ballet performance is great for the sole. I question my ability to dance but am told that yes I can. So much more... There is very little drama in life and don;t promote it- BUT WAIT, I have grown kids; sometimes that presents ???  Life has tried and blessed me in many different ways. I am thankful for many of them and grateful to God for pulling me through others. I may never be financially rich, but secure; yet more importantly living to be happy. Moving forward in this POF fishing trip, I am casting for that special woman that it feels right sharing/experiencing life together. If I could sum up myself- shy initially, born and raised country boy at heart, big city employs me and grandparents instilled etiquette and morals. In search of a best friend for relationship; spending time with that special woman.In closing, I offer a HUG, to move you closer to whom you are in search of, myself or another,God Bless!"

I see no reason to walk around and be rude. I can't stand when I hold a door open for someone and they can't make the time to say thanks. Just a pet peeve of mind.

1045,Bigblueeyes1969,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"I am a well built fitness guy that loves to travel, with room service of course :) I'm down to earth, don't judge people too harshly, and have mellowed nicely with age. Fast sports cars, old slot machines, hiking in the Rockies, and lots of time in Tahoe, Vegas, and the Oregon coast. Hoping to find an attractive down to earth lady who feels comfortable in both jeans and a coctail dress."
1046,JohnA5150,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"Are you a smart, fun, sexy woman who’d like to finally meet a cool, normal guy? If so, you and I might just get along. Read on and let’s find out together…First, a little about me. I’m 42 years old, fit, fun, interesting, and a successful small business owner with a wickedly smart brain and well developed sense of sarcastic humor. I’ll make you laugh in spite of yourself, even when you know you shouldn’t. I’m a master at innuendo, witty sayings and comebacks, with a lightning fast mind and razor sharp tongue (you’re welcome to test me on this, if you think you can put me in my place).You might even call me an arrogant jerk, the kind you love to hate, but then wind up hating yourself for loving. But that’s OK, the risk is most certainly worth the reward. Lookit, I’m a normal guy. I like NFL football, big steaks, money, lifting heavy weights, off color jokes and funny stories, sexy women, fast cars, giant TV’s and all the other things that make life worth living. I don’t have any emotional issues, crazy ex-wives or girlfriends, and the biggest source of stress in my life is the Dallas Cowboys injury report. I am, in short, drama free, and I intend to stay that way. I must be different than most other men because I’m actually pretty happy and had a great childhood.What you won’t get from me is an endless barrage of text messages, moronic pictures of private parts, the obligatory abs in the bathroom mirror shot, one word messages proclaiming “yur hot,” or any of the other nonsense I understand is prevalent on these dating sites. What you will get is a real, honest to goodness man, with likable, manly flaws who will meet you in person and show up on time, looking just like I do in my pictures.Why am I on here, you ask? The answer is simple: it’s a way for me to meet a great woman I might not meet anywhere else, nothing more, nothing less. I am a man open to new experiences, and this certainly is one of them.So, you ask, what kind of woman am I looking for? Well, I happen to like the company of very intelligent, fit, uncommonly sexy women who other men find “intimidating.” Height doesn’t matter (I’ve dated tall and short women), and age really isn’t that much of an issue to me. But fitness IS important to me, so if you don’t work out or keep in shape, please pass.I also like sweet, fun, sexy women with a sparkle in their eye that turns to fire when the time is right, and who have amazing “energy.” If men tell you that you have “great energy,” then you and I will get along just fine.OK, let’s talk about what I’m not looking for, because this is important. If you’re frightened of luxury and nice places, you and I are not destined to get along. I can’t abide show-off’s who throw money around, but neither do I like people who revel in cheapness. Life is meant to be fully enjoyed, and I mean to fully enjoy it. However, that does not mean indulging in destructive behavior…I want to keep what I have. So, if you drink excessively or do any kind of drugs whatsoever, you’re not for me—it’s never 420 time at my place. Ever. However, if you hate drinking, you’re not for me either… I happen to appreciate good wine, fine whiskey, and expensive cigars, all in moderation (it's cool if you don't drink, just can't stand moralizers). And while I’m not interested in total sluts who hook up with a different man every day, neither am I interested in prudes—I get along with women who have a healthy appreciation for the “physical things” in life. Age is not especially important to me, but I find I get along well with women 30 and above who have some life experience, although if you’re younger and mature for your age, I’m certainly open to making an exception. Do I sound like your kind of guy? If so, then here’s what to do next: send me a message, tell me some cool things about yourself, test my claim of a quick and witty mind, and we’ll see what happens next. Oh, and while I am certainly the kind of guy who will make the first move to initiate contact with an attractive woman, there is simply no way I can browse all of the profiles on here (there are a lot of them). So, if you think I sound interested, just send me a quick ""hey,"" and I'll take it from there, even if you're the kind of woman who likes the man to make the first move. I may never see your profile otherwise, and it'd be a shame to potentially miss out on something great that could have been started by one word... "

1078,KWStir,M,Some college,Caucasian,Hello I'm Going to be honest ......... Probably more honest than you would like for me to be. This site is very disappointing . There is women on here that aren't women. Women on here trying to get you to give them money. Women on here that are offering sexual favors for money. So here it goes all of you women that are actually women on here that are looking for a good man that you think does not exist. They exist I am one yes I'm standing up patting myself on the back and telling you. I love to joke I love to make you laugh I love to be affectionate I love to get to know who you are and what makes you tick. I'm a great cook and I enjoy doing it I will clean the house I will pick up my own shit. I do understand that we are different. I am recently divorced and I'm not afraid or ashamed to tell you I did not want to be divorced I was married for 10 years to the woman of my dreams she was a beautiful sarcastic soft-spoken for the most part woman when it came to children she had a heart of gold . But let me tell you where it went wrong and I'm not going to blame her completely and I'm not going to blame myself completely as we all know in relationships it takes two. Here's the part that I really would like for you to pay attention to cuz it will help you understand what most men are about. Like I told you I'm loving and I'm affectionate. I'm going to give herall that I have but when you get nothing in return and the person that you're in love with doesn't treat you the way that you was treated in the beginning and you don't completely have your eyes on the Lord and living the way you should with Grace and understanding you make a lot of mistakes. She stopped being attentive she stopped caring about what I liked or what I needed and if I'm honest I would have to say that I kind of treated her the same way( tit for tat ) trust me that never works most of us treat people that way if you treat me like sh*tI'm going to treat you like shit. We should treat each person in our relationship how we want to be treated at all times no matter how they treat you and just pray that it will come back to you eventually. But women let me tell you if you don't take care of your man he's going to start screwing up I mean really there's a reason that most large towns has tons of strip joints why do you think that is if a woman was to treat her man like the strippers do in the strip joints they would never go to them that's a hint and a tip that you need to pay attention to. If a man's nuts are always drained they won't have the desire to run around on you. You got to get that poison out of their system. You got to tell him that you appreciate him let him know how thankful you are to have him in your life. It's not hard to have a good man all you have to do is treat them no matter how they treat you like you did in the beginning and ladies I would tell every man the same treat your wife and your girlfriend like you did the first two or three weeks of your relationship throughout your entire relationship always keep your eyes on God and love one another with Grace and understanding.ladies don't get me wrong there's still some guys out there that are just real pieces of sh*tjust like there's women out there that are real pieces of shit. Okay I'm off my soapbox go on about your day.

I've always liked meeting new people but lately I've found that I have less and fewer venues to do so, so here I am. If you want to know more don't hesitate to ask, I'm easy to talk to.

As long as your a having good time everything will work itself out., and if your not usually it makes for a funny story later anyway. Im always up to try something new, recently got the road trip bug so I'm looking for my next adventure, never know where you might end up. I also like hiking, biking, kayaking, don't mind getting cleaned up n heading out, festivals of all types, day trips, anything as long as there good people around to do it with. Life should be fun shouldn't it?"
1107,TheCoffeeCulture,M,Associates Degree,Caucasian,"What if, when talking to our friends, co-workers, or even complete strangers, we could skip the small talk, and instead talk about the things that really mattered in life? We don’t have much time these days to scroll through a thousand profiles and maybe saying hi to a handful of them. Take a chance and say: Hi, how are you? this question does go a long way. Talk to me about your life story, not just your Saturday afternoon. Let's discuss aliens, culture, philosophy, romance, marriage ideas. I want to make this positive and not full of ""I don't want"".So, like my profile, say hi, or give me feedback. Maybe there is something you think I should change or write differently to stand out. ?? Like most of you, I am trying to find something specific. I am not big on online dating but with school and work, I thought I would give it a shot. Most of us are here to find someone special. I have a pretty straight forward way of thinking. I may not look it, but at first, I am shy when meeting new people. For the most part, I am a pretty laid-back person. Very blunt, outgoing, and logical. I love coffee and boxer dogs. I am not a drinker and honestly could care less about the bar scene. If you drink, that’s okay.Everyone does their own thing. Now, I have a wide variety of interests these days. A complete hopeless romantic, and the cheesy cuddling, and laying around staring at the stars at night. This doesn’t mean Netflix and chill. There is so much more to me, and I will probably edit this like five times. I consider myself a bit of a nerd but more of a geek. I’m all about random road trips (when I have the time) which I suppose aren’t random. As an adult, it is harder to play hooky. I love watching movies but rarely watch TV shows except for Nat Geo, Science Channel, History channel and anything basically educational."
1108,coondog57,M,High school,Caucasian,"I am very easy going and laid-back. I enjoy the thought of spending quality time would that very special lady. I am not a hard man to please. But I take every opportunity and every ounce of my being to please and make happy the special woman that I''m with. Two things in this world that I''m in love with. Besides Jesus Christ, I am in love with babies and old people. I think the biggest reason is because they need you. And it is very uplifting to be needed. I am honest, sincere, committed, and loyal and faithful to one woman. I am very content with being content. Ladies I want to leave a note of Interest concerning my experience on all of the dating sites. If you are a woman who acts like you are still in junior high school and wants to play the field bye keeping a shopping list of men or if you are a scammer, then I have absolutely no interest in hearing from you. These scammers have become very very easy to detect. And the women who seemingly appear to be legit are generally just a bunch of players better keeping a shopping list to potentially and perhaps eventually choose hey man. Personally, I do not believe that the women on these dating sites are really looking for a relationship. I am an honest and sincere man who has an honest and sincere interest and one woman and one woman only. When I meet a woman on one of these dating sites that I have an interest in and it would appear that she has an interest in me oh, I am going to focus all of my efforts and attention towards her. That's just one of my old school values that still mean something to me today. But as I said. I am not in the least bit interested and being on any woman's shopping list and I will not play the game. And also as I mentioned. The scammers have become so easy to identify that I generally do not even respond. But on the other hand. If there is such a woman out there on these dating sites that truly has a honest and sincere interest and having one good man in her life oh, that I would like very much to hear from you. Otherwise, you can pass me right on by. Is there any woman out on any of these dating sites that really wants a relationship?"

I do however have a few biker traits in me. I'm open to exploring the possibilities with whomever I meet. I live in the sticks just outside of the boonies. It's nice out there. I tend to be overly honest. Yes, it can be a bad thing! Okay, time to scare of 85% of my potential partners. Although statistically speaking, over 50% of them are in the same boat and don't know it.. There's a little test that most people don't know about, but it's an important one. It never made sense to me why it isn't a part of the standard STD test, but it's not. You actually have to specifically ask to be tested in order for them to do it. I'm talking about herpes. The stigma that goes along with it amazes me. So, if you haven't figured it out yet, yes, I have herpes. It's a fact that I personally feel the need to share immediately. If you don't ""really"" know much about it, you should research it, and get tested.."

1129,ricko78717,M,Bachelors Degree,Caucasian,"I work hard, but play harder. Im looking for someone who can appreciate that. I enjoy a good dinner, then off to some fun activity. Preferably not a movie, as you really cannot get to know someone during a movie. Sense of humor is definitely a good thing. If you claim to be a smart ass, then we'll get along great. Sarcasm is good. Someone who is able to go camping and be comfortable would be fantastic. I do like to be outdoors, staying in is a rarity. That doesn't mean I'm at the club every night of the week, I just prefer being out at the park, or just sitting on my patio with a nice crown and coke every now and then. You'll find that my playlist has perhaps the most random collection of music on it ever. From R&B to Dropkick Murphies to some techno (90's) to even a little hip-hop. I'm somewhat set in my career, but as with everything I do, there is room for improvement. I strive each day to improve something in my life. About me a little more: I'm 6'5"" non-smoker for almost five years now, don't mind the occasional drink but that part of my life is for the most part over. I run nearly every day, from 5 to 7 miles. Something I realize I have to do, because I enjoy great (because I seriously got a response saying they enjoyed only great food - really?)food way too much to give it up. Work as a system architect for a point of sale company.  Defintiely looking for something long term, no doubt, if the right person comes along. If you're capable of investing some time in me, and find me interesting, I'll do what I can to invest my time in you and take it from there. Why not start today? :)If you want to know me more, IM me on y! djrickdstik2000. I promise not to bite."

I'm I have the southern/latino upbringing, but I am Deutschland konstruiert ,but hecho en Mexico (like Volkswagen). I'm considered an odd fellow (goofy/funny). I am a humble, loyal man that doesn't ask for much. I live a simple lifestyle and tend to keep to myself most of the time so I tend to get lost in thought. I'm always looking at how the world functions and built; it's looking at man made and natural objects and how they fit into the scheme of things. I'm a 3D environmental artist by trade. I'm a huge hockey fan and my team are the Dallas Stars(NHL)/Texas Stars(AHL). If you're a lady that enjoys hockey, art, video games, or just about all things geek then you had my attention, but now you have my curiosity. I'm just looking for a woman that is down to earth, semi or fully environmental conscience, funny, likes to have fun, and notices the smaller things of life. I have a bunch of memories that I will always cherish, and when I'm ready; I would enjoy making new moments with a new. I upgraded to relationship; please bare with me, One quirk I do have is that I say 'eh' quite a bit; I did have a roomie that was Canadian so it kind of rubbed off on me, eh. See, can't help it.I’m working on myself by working out and you should as well. Are there real women out there? I guess not.
