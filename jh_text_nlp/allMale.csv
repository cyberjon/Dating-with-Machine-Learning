I had it with the dating apps, complained to unknown numbers of strangers that the apps were shallow and ruining the whole human interaction thing...and what did I do to stand up for principles and my experiences? Solved it with another dating app. Yeah, let’s do that. Smart man. Then again, I did learn a lot. Heck, just a few days ago I went on the worst date of my whole life. I’ll spare you the details but I’ll share that lies are a terrible way to gain the affection of this man.Yes, the dating apps molded me, shaped me and taught me exactly what I didn’t want. They taught me that I too can feel bad about myself if I don’t have a standard and boundaries. They taught me that I am not in competition with any male. I’m just searching for something I lack. I don’t need or want any woman. I want the right woman. I don’t care what you look like. I care who you are. I don’t need companionship. I want a friend. I’m not desperate. I simply want someone to love that loves me back. I don’t want to go on dates. I want to spend my time with someone I like being around.I could continue that list on and on but I think you want to know about who I am. What to say? Should I write words to woo you? Or say things you want to hear? Ugh. How about some truth? Then maybe you can deduce who I am...I know you wonderful people are walking BS detectors. I’m divorced because we never should have gotten married just because we had a kid. We tried to make it work for 10 years cause that’s what you do, right? Terrible choice. We simply should never have gone that way. But now we are all happier. I believe the father is the most lacking thing our values have forgotten. Just about every statistic about crime or education or single moms involves the lack of committed dads. I believe in talking it out. I don’t need to change you, future companion. I do know how to be introspective and share my feelings. Some of my brothers can’t do that and I’m sorry for them. One of my strengths is being able to detect something needs to be talked about and not solved. That venting and talking is just about the most relaxing thing here is. Almost. I’m a super engaged dad. My kids are homeschooled. No, you don’t need to change anything for me/us. I got this. Just know I value the freedom of being able to teach my kids and give them a gift very few of us get. No, homeschool is not better - just better for us. To each their own. I am an introvert. No, it doesn’t mean I can’t stare longingly into your eyes or push up my glasses (none) with my finger or can’t confront someone that needs to be checked. It means simply that I recharge my social batteries by quiet and calm, by being around the familiar and safe. I can act like any extrovert for a time but it’s exhausting. Fellow introverts know what’s up. I want to give to you so much I can’t stand it. I want to support you 150%. When you are busy I want to run your errands. When you are sick I want to do everything to serve you. When we need time to ourselves I want to shield us. When you are growing I want to lift you up. However, I want you to do the same. I want unconditional support and to give it as well. Every relationship I’ve ever been in has taught me - THAT is the way. I can feel it. Exactly what good friends do. Can we strive for that?

I designed the layout for Green Dolphin Street on the back of a****ail napkin while dictating the great American novel to my younger brother, who I'll call Hewson. I once taught a platoon of infantrymen to recite by heart poems by Walt Whitman without so much as moving their lips. Many of my peers know me only by the name “Satchmo” and will swear up and down that I am a real stand up kind of guy. I voted for Bush….twice. (I'm a Libertarian that votes occasionally R, and I did not vote for Trump...or Hillary for that matter) I pass my days making dolls for children in Africa and memorizing quotes from Victorian literature. I knit all my own socks. I coined the phrase, *It s all good* in 1987 in order to cope with the loss of my second true love (and never looked back.) I have thirteen diplomas, twelve of them honorary. Residents of Prague and Lima look to me as a pillar of strength and hygiene. I am two degrees from Kevin Bacon (two different ways), unaffected by weather, and can tell a person's eye color by talking to them on the telephone. I let the dogs out. OK, on the serious side...I'm a fairly intelligent, above average looking, slightly overworked guy. I'm looking here because it seems I never have enough time and for once I thought I'd let technology work for me instead of the other way around. I like being outdoors, whether it's on my bike or on the golf course. Live music is one of my passions; otherwise, you can find me hanging out with my friends, playing pool, throwing darts, making fun of each other, etc. I'm looking for a woman who is funny, smart, ambitious, responsible, confident, physically and emotionally healthy, happy with herself most of the time, and sweet...not necessarily in that order, a woman who's insightful and willing to fight for what she believes in, someone I can respect and always count on to do what she says. It's important to me that a woman has a handle on who she is and what she wants in life. A woman who can challenge me intellectually and make me laugh is extremely important (Is there any way to underline that in BOLD type?). Great chemistry is very important to me too - attractiveness is really only one small factor in that equation. I'm not looking for someone to make me happy or complete me...I am happy, and pretty much have all my ____ together. I'm looking for the icing on the cake. If you suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome (Don't blame me, I voted for Gary Johnson) please move on...nothing to see here.P.S. - If you don't look like your profile, you have to buy me drinks until you do...P.P.S.

Liberals and I don't get along. If you only have face pictures I'm not going to respond, I keep getting tricked by profiles that read average, athletic, slender etc... And then find out I was lied to. Please be honest! Everything in my profile is the truth and really don't appreciate the dishonesty. This also applies to only one profile pictures. 8 times out of 10 they are fake profiles with stolen images. And yes, I'm quickly losing interest in this site because of it.I am not a boy, and don't play games, when it comes to my heart or yours. If you've ever seen classic films or John Wayne movies, then you know what you're getting into here. I believe that a man should be a man, and a woman should be completely girly. I don't subscribe to the concept of any other types of genders. I respect mothers who raised girls to be women, If you believe or were raised to treat your man right, then I'm the man who will treat you like a Queen. I won't kiss your a$$, and I am honest to a fault. I have been off the market and have become the man God wants me to be. I am not politically correct, I am a Christ follower and I am not perfect. I am however still working on this. When I'm in a relationship, I believe that I am property of my woman and she is mine. You get extra points if you enoy wearing skirts and dresses, enjoy rom-coms and are affectionate. I am very affectionate and love to hold the woman who holds my heart. I'm not looking for ""Hot"" or ""Sexy"" (too much psycho and drama there) I want a cute face, a slender, voluptuous or average figure that keeps my interest and my hands on you whenever you walk by. Each of my past relationships, have made me a better person and taught me how to cherish the woman I'm with. I'm open to meet, and if there's a spark of interest and chemistry, we can start as friends, then see if we mutually want to take it beyond that. I am witty, sarcastic and cheeky, so you can't be overly sensitive to jokes. I love hearing the laughter of the woman I love, and really am attracted to the sound of a woman's voice, playfulness, and sexiness. Lastly, If you need an ""outdoor"" guy, that's not me. I enjoy technology and the benefits of today's modern age. I love relaxing to Country Music, Smooth Jazz, Instrumental soundtracks, Classical, and Christian music (KLOVE). I read my Bible every morning and am starting my 4th re-read of old and new testament. If you've ever watched Little House on the Prairie, then You can grasp my faith lifestyle. It's similar to Charles Ingles.I have noticed that women tend to prefer men of a certain height, so I respect that. Just as we men tend to prefer women of a certain weight, so please respect that.

It's fine if you don't relate to any or all of it and don't favorite me or contact me. That's the idea of a profile. All my friends are really interesting people. I've had my share of relationships and I've gained and learned from all of them. Even negative experiences contain valuable lessons. I decided to give POF a try for interesting people. In a study, there are 3 questions that create a high correlation between people and their success as a couple:1. “Do you like scary movies?” (No, The Shining is about my limit.)2. “Have you ever traveled to another country alone?” (Yes, multiple times.)3. “Would you like to ditch it all and go live on a sailboat?” (Sure, why not. This also applies to ditching everything, getting a very nice RV and seeing North America.)4. (This one is mine from personal experience) No psychologists. I've never met a sane one, after all, what is sane? But the last one I met must have been off her meds for a very long time. LOL.If you don't match those then please look elsewhere. You're doing us both a favor, and thank you. If you do match then I appreciate your time reading the rest of this.Oh...and one more. You need a College Degree and not just from the School of Hard Knocks as we all graduated from there and still take remote courses. Master Degrees and multiple Master's or a PhD go to the top of the list. Experience counts as well, as does running your own business for a number of years. I don't care about your money and you better not care about mine but I am concerned about the brain I'm going to be around for the rest of my life and you should be the same. Ever played Codenames? I make time for the things I want to do and share, and for the important people in my life.In a relationship I am looking for:The ability to discuss issues with intelligence and facts instead of emotion and warrantless assertions. Great experiences with one another. Educations in life or in school or both. A love of travel and adventure for the new and personally undiscovered. A love for passion in many things and sharing to continue to have a joyful and meaningful life!Being right can be important in work, but in personal relationships, the ability to be kind, forgiving and caring of the other person in a relationship is important...really important. Being negative is just a drag. PDA and touching are just fine too.If your tack smart then you're confident and funny. You can laugh at yourself and almost everything in life. You appreciate a subtle pun when you hear it, and fart jokes are still funny. You also respect a wonderful $18.34 bottle of cab, a $7.54 bottle of some great blend from the HEB as well as some wonderful mixologist's efforts at an old rustic hotel bar in Santa Fe. You'll tolerate me getting a 5-guys burger wrapped in lettuce (or maybe we'll get two!) and then recommend some excellent undiscovered restaurant where we can talk about life and laugh the evening away. If god or God is important in your life then so be it, but it's not in mine. I am an ordained minister in The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (I paid for the certificate to prove it as well). I'm a poorly-practicing Buddhist (new land sect), and if I was to convert I'd go Jewish as they have great parties, more holidays, and none of the Jesus and Hell stuff. I get spiritual, I get nature and the grandness of things - it is amazing.If you're a Trump supporter then seek counseling. I'm likely a raging liberal business person (self-employed for 16 years) that sees the emperor's clothes of trickle-down economics. If you want to really stimulate the economy you have to give people the ability to spend money (that whole velocity of money is true). Lowering taxes does not create jobs. I'm also back in the IT world with a great job that takes up a lot of time.I can leave a lot behind but I can't part with truth....And that's the only thing I need is *this*. I don't need this or this. Just this ashtray... And this paddle game. - The ashtray and the paddle game and that's all I need... And this remote control. - The ashtray, the paddle game, and the remote control, and that's all I need... And these matches. - The ashtray, and these matches, and the remote control, and the paddle ball... And this lamp. - The ashtray, this paddle game, and the remote control, and the lamp, and that's all *I* need. And that's *all* I need too. I don't need one other thing, not one... I need this. - The paddle game and the chair, and the remote control, and the matches for sure. Well, what are you looking at? What do you think I'm some kind of a jerk or something! - And this. That's all I need.Things I don't like:Popping gum. Talking with food in your mouth.Bad personal hygiene.Negativity...as being positive and having a good lookout is beautiful.For me, If life gives you lemons, you make lemon propelled grenades and lemon juice powered flamethrowers.You're still cool if you're a bit late. You can plan something and then throw it all away to do something else you think is better.As for music, I will listen to almost everything once. Pop country isn't really my thing nor is much rap. However, I'm a fan of The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron, LKJ and some others. Old country and Americana is great. I still buy CDs and recently pick up the latest from TuneYards and Sara Bareilles. There is a massive vinyl collection in storage (lots of Jazz), plus I was involved in sound production and radio for many years.Much of life makes me laugh, but some of it makes me cry. Rick and Morty make me laugh as does Felix the Cat, Dave Chappelle, and Maria Bamford. If I can stay up that late I love catching Colbert's monologues. Patton Oswalt and Temple Grandin both make me laugh and cry.There is SO MUCH to go do and so little time.Passion, intelligence, being perceptive, optimistic and a wicked sense of humor are a few ways to describe me.

I have a great job, take my job and career very seriously, get great satisfaction from it, but I do not live to work. Health and fitness are very important to me. I tend to work out as often as my schedule will permit. On the weekends I like to go out (dinner, drinks, movies, live music, sporting events), but I also like to stay in (watch TV or a movie) and hang out on the couch. I have a passion for cars and spend some time playing with them.I am looking for someone to have fun with that will hopefully lead to a serious/long term relationship. This online dating thing is a little different. From experience I have found it does not make much sense to email back and forth for weeks without meeting the other person. So many times I have gotten to know a very nice person only to find that there is absolutely no chemistry. Also, I will not communicate with members who have not posted pictures.My ideal mate is attractive (yes, it's important - that being said, beauty is in the eye of the beholder), fit, intelligent, and hard working. She is my best friend. She is caring, compassionate, and empathetic. She is passionate and affectionate. She communicates well. She likes fine dining and greasy spoons. She likes getting dressed up and likes hanging out in a t-shirt and ball cap. She is refined - I can take her to work functions, and she is laid back - likes to listen to live music. She likes sports, UFC (I know, it's a stretch), cars, animals, etc. She is neat and organized.

I believe that in a relationship both parties need to be good listeners, communicate better and express our likes /dislike as well as our expectations very clearly. Many times in a relationship we fail to communicate or our true feelings therefore misunderstanding occur, our partner get hurt not intentionally but because none of us are capable of reading the other's mind. The failure to communicate is clearly the reason of hurt feelings. I also, believe that the key to a healthy relationship is putting our partner's feeling first above all else. We need to be aware on how we say things to the one we love and learn to interact better. I consider myself a caring, loving, loyal, honest and faithful man.

Hmm okay, being single I have developed some poor habits too, sorry not perfect. Qualities :) Not bad with construction repairs/skills and I do well with mechanical repairs (my vehicles are older because I can repair them). Now gardening, landscape maintenance is okay, but my green thumb keeps turning brown. Golf is an activity/social events that keeps me additionally active. Used to, I was exposed to farm/ranch life, did my share of riding horses and working cattle and was in the middle of numerous other country animals-some of the best of times of life. Maybe I should mention water activities, since I grew up in the coastal region fishing, skiing, swimming and lots of beach time.

I question my ability to dance but am told that yes I can. So much more... There is very little drama in life and don;t promote it- BUT WAIT, I have grown kids; sometimes that presents ???

match_501,JohnA5150,Best Man Ever!,"['Good whiskey', 'Fine Wine', 'Expensive cigars']","Are you a smart, fun, sexy woman who’d like to finally meet a cool, normal guy? If so, you and I might just get along. Read on and let’s find out together…First, a little about me. I’m 42 years old, fit, fun, interesting, and a successful small business owner with a wickedly smart brain and well developed sense of sarcastic humor. I’ll make you laugh in spite of yourself, even when you know you shouldn’t. I’m a master at innuendo, witty sayings and comebacks, with a lightning fast mind and razor sharp tongue (you’re welcome to test me on this, if you think you can put me in my place).You might even call me an arrogant jerk, the kind you love to hate, but then wind up hating yourself for loving. But that’s OK, the risk is most certainly worth the reward. Lookit, I’m a normal guy. I like NFL football, big steaks, money, lifting heavy weights, off color jokes and funny stories, sexy women, fast cars, giant TV’s and all the other things that make life worth living. I don’t have any emotional issues, crazy ex-wives or girlfriends, and the biggest source of stress in my life is the Dallas Cowboys injury report. I am, in short, drama free, and I intend to stay that way. I must be different than most other men because I’m actually pretty happy and had a great childhood.What you won’t get from me is an endless barrage of text messages, moronic pictures of private parts, the obligatory abs in the bathroom mirror shot, one word messages proclaiming “yur hot,” or any of the other nonsense I understand is prevalent on these dating sites. What you will get is a real, honest to goodness man, with likable, manly flaws who will meet you in person and show up on time, looking just like I do in my pictures.Why am I on here, you ask? The answer is simple: it’s a way for me to meet a great woman I might not meet anywhere else, nothing more, nothing less. I am a man open to new experiences, and this certainly is one of them.So, you ask, what kind of woman am I looking for? Well, I happen to like the company of very intelligent, fit, uncommonly sexy women who other men find “intimidating.” Height doesn’t matter (I’ve dated tall and short women), and age really isn’t that much of an issue to me. But fitness IS important to me, so if you don’t work out or keep in shape, please pass.I also like sweet, fun, sexy women with a sparkle in their eye that turns to fire when the time is right, and who have amazing “energy.” If men tell you that you have “great energy,” then you and I will get along just fine.OK, let’s talk about what I’m not looking for, because this is important. If you’re frightened of luxury and nice places, you and I are not destined to get along. I can’t abide show-off’s who throw money around, but neither do I like people who revel in cheapness. Life is meant to be fully enjoyed, and I mean to fully enjoy it. However, that does not mean indulging in destructive behavior…I want to keep what I have. So, if you drink excessively or do any kind of drugs whatsoever, you’re not for me—it’s never 420 time at my place. Ever. However, if you hate drinking, you’re not for me either… I happen to appreciate good wine, fine whiskey, and expensive cigars, all in moderation (it's cool if you don't drink, just can't stand moralizers). And while I’m not interested in total sluts who hook up with a different man every day, neither am I interested in prudes—I get along with women who have a healthy appreciation for the “physical things” in life. Age is not especially important to me, but I find I get along well with women 30 and above who have some life experience, although if you’re younger and mature for your age, I’m certainly open to making an exception. Do I sound like your kind of guy? If so, then here’s what to do next: send me a message, tell me some cool things about yourself, test my claim of a quick and witty mind, and we’ll see what happens next. Oh, and while I am certainly the kind of guy who will make the first move to initiate contact with an attractive woman, there is simply no way I can browse all of the profiles on here (there are a lot of them). So, if you think I sound interested, just send me a quick ""hey,"" and I'll take it from there, even if you're the kind of woman who likes the man to make the first move. I may never see your profile otherwise, and it'd be a shame to potentially miss out on something great that could have been started by one word...

match_530,KWStir,Let's give it a try.,None,Hello I'm Going to be honest ......... Probably more honest than you would like for me to be. This site is very disappointing . There is women on here that aren't women. Women on here trying to get you to give them money. Women on here that are offering sexual favors for money. So here it goes all of you women that are actually women on here that are looking for a good man that you think does not exist. They exist I am one yes I'm standing up patting myself on the back and telling you. I love to joke I love to make you laugh I love to be affectionate I love to get to know who you are and what makes you tick. I'm a great cook and I enjoy doing it I will clean the house I will pick up my own shit. I do understand that we are different. I am recently divorced and I'm not afraid or ashamed to tell you I did not want to be divorced I was married for 10 years to the woman of my dreams she was a beautiful sarcastic soft-spoken for the most part woman when it came to children she had a heart of gold . But let me tell you where it went wrong and I'm not going to blame her completely and I'm not going to blame myself completely as we all know in relationships it takes two. Here's the part that I really would like for you to pay attention to cuz it will help you understand what most men are about. Like I told you I'm loving and I'm affectionate. I'm going to give herall that I have but when you get nothing in return and the person that you're in love with doesn't treat you the way that you was treated in the beginning and you don't completely have your eyes on the Lord and living the way you should with Grace and understanding you make a lot of mistakes. She stopped being attentive she stopped caring about what I liked or what I needed and if I'm honest I would have to say that I kind of treated her the same way( tit for tat ) trust me that never works most of us treat people that way if you treat me like sh*tI'm going to treat you like shit. We should treat each person in our relationship how we want to be treated at all times no matter how they treat you and just pray that it will come back to you eventually. But women let me tell you if you don't take care of your man he's going to start screwing up I mean really there's a reason that most large towns has tons of strip joints why do you think that is if a woman was to treat her man like the strippers do in the strip joints they would never go to them that's a hint and a tip that you need to pay attention to. If a man's nuts are always drained they won't have the desire to run around on you. You got to get that poison out of their system. You got to tell him that you appreciate him let him know how thankful you are to have him in your life. It's not hard to have a good man all you have to do is treat them no matter how they treat you like you did in the beginning and ladies I would tell every man the same treat your wife and your girlfriend like you did the first two or three weeks of your relationship throughout your entire relationship always keep your eyes on God and love one another with Grace and understanding.ladies don't get me wrong there's still some guys out there that are just real pieces of sh*tjust like there's women out there that are real pieces of shit.
