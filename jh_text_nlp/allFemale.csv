match_124,LoveMichi83,Where is my God centered man??,"['Church', 'Christian music', 'Bible study']","Hi, hope you are having an awesome and blessed day. My name is Michelle, thank you for your interest in reading my profile.... -> Looking for my best friend, in the hopes that one day, it will turn into marriage. Preferences: 5'10 or taller and age range 38-44 Raised in the USA: I am part French and part Mexican= Frenxican, LOLI was born in CD. Juarez Chihuahua Mexico (6yrs)Raised in El Paso TX (15years)Moved to Austin area to attend college and stayed We really like it here! (16years end of January) Important: What you are about to read, will keep the right men interested in me, and will keep the wrong guy away... I am not here for a ""free meal"" or anything like that. I am here looking for something serious. We learn from our experiences and become better individuals for our future. It's all about perspective and being positive! A little bit about myself: I am a single mother of three kids (from the same father). Their dad is in Houston visits them when he gets a chance. I keep myself busy with a full time job that I love, two part time jobs that only attend to about 2-6hrs a week, try to make time to hang out with my kids, and we are active at church. It really just depends what is going on. Please don't let all this discourage you from messaging me. I do make time to respond to texts on my breaks/lunch and will make time to hang out or go on a date with the man that really wants to be with me. I am a one man woman, and when I meet him and feel like he's The One, just then and only then, I will get off this site. First things first.... My best friend and true love must put God 1st.I am a devoted Christian woman, and I seek a man who is God centered and has a relationship with God. A God Centered Man: A true man of God is; trustworthy, honest, confident, respectful, serves others, fearless, compassionate, and loving. A true man of God is not; prideful, rude, sarcastic, disrespectful, mean, does not manipulate, nor will he hurt anyone in any way.My Walk as a devoted Christian woman: A little bit about why a relationship with God is important to me and my significant other needs to be a true faithful man of God....*I was born into a Christian family, however I never felt a relationship with God until now. My parents got divorced when I was a teenager and we stopped attending church, my mom lost faith. Later when I became an adult, I would attend church sometimes, read the Bible, and prayed. I believed that was enough.... but it wasn't.I went through sooo many things.... until one day I had nothing and had many many obstacles..... my mission leader told me one day, get on your knees and pray. I did and my life changed forever. God started answering my prayers, fast! I decided to get baptized at my current church, and be more involved serving others (teacher at church) and a student in bible studies. One day I asked God to use me in His favor.He annointed me with the Holy Spirit and sent me as a missionary to Mexico, and now I am also a prayer partner at church.**I still have lots to learn and do. I am not perfect. However, it is extremely important who we allow into our life, into our minds, and into our heart and soul. I learn from my mistakes, and make changes as I grow.Life is about changing, but changing for the better. A true relationship: I am here looking for my true love, a serious friendship that will turn into marriage, I am in no rush. To be friends 1st will allow us to get to know each other better; learning how to communicate with each other, develop trust, be honest, and respect each other's time. I am very confident about myself, I know exactly what I want and need. However, I am not perfect, but always improving. I have learned to be alone and not feel lonely.Relationships is something that we need to work on daily, showing respect, having communication, caring for each another, being honest, and being compassionate. What do you seek physically in a woman? Physically I call myself average. I am active-working out again. Walking, jogging, INSANITY (occasionally), and small weights. Body type is Not too big or small.I carry myself very well and I find myself attractive. My best attributes are my beautiful long wavy/curly hair, big brown eyes, nice lips, and long legs. Let's talk about LOVE: These are the 5 Love Languages: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch.This is how I feel about them: we all feel some are more important than the rest.... #1- Words of Affirmation (attention).Complementing each other Extremely Important. Makes you feel attracted to your significant other, more confident, and makes you feel positive and happy.It's really sad to feel lonely when you are next to someone who doesn't give you the attention nor do they talk to you. Sometimes it makes you feel that you are the only one doing it.... not good... starts making you doubt who you are with.#2- Quality Time When in a relationship, I believe it's important to do almost everything together. There's times that yes, we can enjoy being with friends without our significant other. As long as there is trust and communication.#3- Acts of Service I am a single mother of three kids, I don't have a man around. If there's anything to be done that might be more for a man to do, I'd like for the man in my life to step up and help. Or help others- super attractive #4- Receiving Gifts This is super important when starting a relationship. It makes each other feel special. This tells us that our significant other was thinking about us. #5- Physical Touch I seek a man I can call my best friend- which means I can trust in and won't judge me, but will know what to tell me. Be there for me when I need him the most. Someone I can be myself with and won't try to manipulate me to be someone I am not. Hugs and kisses are important in my culture- I am Mexican, hugs help in many ways: Helps release stress, feel loved, can take you from being mad to calm to down. Also, since I am obedient, Intimacy comes later in a relationship (marriage). We need all Five Love Languages in a Relationship.They are all important. If interested please don't be shy and send me a message.I seek my best friend; this creates trust, learn how to communicate, and to be honest with each other. The rest comes later, I am in no rush.

That being said, a dating relationship can not happen if people live too far apart. 3) Dating age range. A good dating age range is 10 years younger or 10 years older....for ANYONE period. No matter how ""young at heart you are, or how ""hot you think you are,"" if you aren't willing to date woman your own age that is a HUGE warning sign!! Men, really.....if you are still trying ""to bag"" a woman 15-20 years younger than yourself....take a good look at yourself in the mirror. Those women want you only if you have money, have ""Daddy-issues"", and will probably want to have kids. Get a grip Gramps! Date women in your own age group and you will be glad you did because they will have more in common with you!I will read your entire profile and I hope you take the time to read my lengthy one as well. As a courtesy, I am honest and upfront, please be kind and mannerly. Crude or inappropriate behavior won’t be tolerated. This is a “dating site, not a hook-up site.” Single means divorced......not separated. There is a difference. I know what I want (not need), I can be alone and not lonely, and don't want to waste anyone's time, so please don't waste mine. Be able to laugh at others as well as yourself! Be brutally honest with yourself first. What you are seeking in a mate, should also be the same things you can supply in a relationship. Send a message with a nice hello and a willingness to get to know one another. If you are going through a mid-life crisis, take too many gym selfies, and include pictures of your tattoos in your profile....go seek help, but please don’t contact me! My baggage in life is the size of a wallet, if you have some Samsonite.....please just keep on wheeling down the road! Lastly, good fishing requires the use of the right kind of bait.

My little buddy.....hit with dementia about 8 weeks ago.....gone from very bad to worse in 48....I’m afraid i’m faced with planning that last vet ‘visit’. Please be patient for any response you are waiting for.....thank you6/25/19 I took Max to the beach for the very last time over the weekend...........today I had to say good bye..........a kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love deeply and be loved in return.Looking for a man that is emotionally ready for the real deal. I want the whole pie in the sky, the goofy sappy kind of love that seems to be so elusive.............not looking for someone to complete me, but rather for someone who wants to hold hands while we walk our path together. Someone honest, loving, compassionate and that will tell me when I have spinach in my teeth! I'm not afraid to let a man take the lead; in some ways, I actually prefer it. (I know, that may seem odd fashioned, but it's just the way I am) However, double standards have no place in a mutually caring relationship.A relationship can settle down into a sort of complacency, you know. You forget the early passion, you forget the heat, you begin to feel comfortable in another sort of intimacy that has nothing to do with sex. Or if it does, it's only because the idea of being loved so completely, is in itself often sexually exciting. I used to say that faith is not a leap in the dark, but a journey in the light, but screw that I am ready to take that leap! You?That crazy little thing called love ... let me describe what I think love looks like in order for us to have a common platform from which to leap. Love is an action. Love is about building trust - when our words are consistent with our actions. Love is having the courage to be open and vulnerable. Love is visibility, friendship, mutual admiration, and strength. Love is the beauty contained within the simple pleasures we experience together. Holding hands. A passionate embrace. A text message to say hello ""just because"". Love is sharing basic values and similarities - with complementary differences. Love is building a future with you while being present in the moment with you. This can also mean a long meaningful walk, a bike ride, just sitting on a bench somewhere people watching. It's not so much about what we choose to do at any given time, it's about doing it together and being present in the moment. It’s kind of silly to state I would like someone that shares my values, why would I want someone who doesn’t?? However, we do not always have to be on the same page, just in the same book! There are times, I will even settle for being in the same set of the encyclopedias. I see many referring to 'baggage'. Well, if you don't have any you probably haven't lived much, and it's not about whether you have it, but how you've dealt with it. At our age we’ve all experienced hurt and/or disappointment on some level; that goes without saying. But maybe life isn’t about avoiding the bruises, maybe it’s about collecting the scars to prove that you showed up for the game.  I’m a very compassionate/empathetic person and pride myself on the ability to put myself in someone else’s shoes. I am a nurturer by nature, but don't let that fool you, I am not a pushover or a doormat. I also believe I’m excellent at treating others the way I would like to be treated, and good at the art of compromise in a relationship. I am looking for that special someone that is like minded, affectionate and comfortable showing that affection via a playful, honest, heartfelt spirit. I love being affectionate, but also feel there is no need to go overboard; sometimes all that is needed is that special look/glance at the perfect time. I have grown accustomed to being alone except for those times when loneliness sets in. I have been told by many that I am too independent. I don't 'need' a man in my life..(ok, I really do)....I 'want' one..........I dream of a man who touches me first thing in the morning, right before my body fully wakes, whose fingers entwine with mine during the day and who’s lips press kisses onto my eyelids as he brushes the hair from my face each night before sleep. I dream of a grown man that knows it is okay to cry and tremble at times, and that it is okay to feel scared about love, loss and loneliness. His vulnerability is what tenderly touches the hidden parts of me. I dream of a man that is not afraid to pull me close when a storms set in, and one who knows his touch is a powerful force when blowing and moving black clouds. I want a man who uses his strength, his sensuality, his softness and sexuality to touch me, physically, intimately, and deeply through my mind, body and soul. Love, happiness, peacefulness, pleasure, honesty, trust, and faithfulness, all these words are what I want to have in my relationship. My perception of an ideal relationship is one in which a loving environment is fostered through mutual respect and genuine interest for each other’s work/interest/life and families. My word is my bond; it's all about integrity. (it's a military thing, HOOAH)I’m really good at: Not being judgmental.Looking at both sides of an argument.Accepting that I cannot change people.Being supportive when the occasion calls for itGiving away knowledge.

I value my relationships with family and friends that are living around the globe and visit them whenever I have a chance. I have a strong faith that informs my life. I enjoy a balance of dressing to impress and leggings days. After 25 years of red hair I recently went blonde and I am loving it! I am not one to be with someone that doesn’t have career aspirations. I am attracted to intelligent, go getters that have their eye on the prize. I am inspired by people that know what they want and are willing to do what it takes to make things happen. I believe life is like a create your own ending story, one where every day you pen another page. I am looking for someone that shares my goals, values and aspirations for life. We don’t have to be identical, but having a set of things you’re passionate about is an essential ingredient. I want to be with someone that can teach me something. He enjoys trying new things and isn’t afraid to get in the car or catch a flight or try a new cuisine. He is a spiritual person that like me has found faith to be an important part in life decisions. He is someone that has a vision for where he would like to be in the next 5, 10 or 20 years. I carry myself like a true lady and I am seeking a gentleman that will see my worth. I am seeking someone that will bring out the best in me, as I hope to be able to bring out the best in you. If you think you could challenge me to become the best version of myself... if you love dreaming about the future and your next adventure, please contact me.

Nothing is more peaceful than going to a deer lease, with your friends, relaxing with the smell of bacon and a campfire in the crisp, cold morning air.... Now, Now Boys, before you have me pictured as calamity Jane; I can guarantee you, I'm 100% woman.. One little bundle of dynamite that you won't forget!  My momma was a great teacher to me as well, she taught me everything I needed to know to keep my man satisfied and happy... through her actions and commitment to my dad, I learned the upmost importance of honesty, trustworthiness, faithfulness and the ability to love someone with all your heart.. Through his stomach, by cooking, baking, getting up early to make breakfast. .. The importance to set the table and have a family meal together . Emotionally, by always being a good listener, to be selfless and supportive.. compassionate and to always remember to hug, cuddle and snuggle those that we love the most. And let them know how much you care for and love them each and everyday..Physically, by taking pride in living healthy, exercising and taking good care of myself, through hygiene as well; Everyman loves the smell of a woman's hair and body when they are freshly bathed, with just the hint of perfume.. ... Keeping a nice clean home. for your man to come home to . . Most importantly, Spiritually, that all things are possible with Our Lord Jesus Christ. To never give up and never ever to go to bed mad.. and to keep this in mind in any relationship ..   If you are still reading, I suppose I have sparked your interest.. I also have a very good heart and when I love, I love with all of it ... Im honest, considerate and respectful, I was raised that way; I still call my elders by sir and ma'am..  I love to laugh and I have a funny sense of humor, I seriously laugh at myself every day for some silly thing that I said or did. I love to cook and bake, entertain and have get togethers, the holidays and Spending time with family and friends..  I love my children and grandchildren with all my heart! Family is very important to me. .. With that said, they are all independent and don't need me as much anymore. So I am free to travel or for the right reasons even relocate.  I have the education, experience and trade that allows me to be financially independent. .. I'm looking for a real good man that has qualities and interests much the same as my own...

But when I want to recharge my batteries, I prefer being with just a few people.Since my hobbies are solo pursuits, let's come up with some things we can do together. Got any ideas?As for religion or spirituality, I swing between agnostic and atheist. While in my world there are no gods (except for perhaps the god of traffic, who has a truly nasty sense of humor), I support the right to believe as you choose. However, if you’re a fundamentalist anything, including a fundamentalist atheist, pass me by, please.Because I don’t believe in divine intervention or an afterlife or karma, I do believe that we humans have a duty to each other to seek justice, fairness and equality for everyone. If there is a wrong, do what you can to change it. If there is a need, fill it. No god is going to do it for us. Offer comfort and compassion always - simple kindness ripples outward in unseen ways, finding those who need it.My job is logic driven, very detail oriented and not in the least creative. It’s in my non-working time that I indulge in creative pursuits that feed my spirit. I read, practice the harp, cook, and write lyrics.

My passions are dancing, music, biking, crafting, nature, hiking, traveling, fun times, movies !All that being stated. I have had to also include the following caution :All scammers, players, users, proceed with caution. I have reported 3 scammers in as many days on this site.I do not use dating sites for playing games or scams. I am serious about connecting with my God given soulmate. To grow old with.I know my worth. I know what I want and need. I am self assured. I have self love and self respect. I know how to love, care & appreciate.The last 2 scammers were hilarious. They actually admitted having studied my written profile. This is a re-do for my profile. Prompted by the scammers preying on single women’s written profiles. Using such greetings as “Gorgeous”, “ Stunning”. That initial red flag only makes me ??????I know the various scripts you clowns use. Time wasted trying to scam would go to better use by working a real job to earn the money. LOSERS,Beware > no scammer, player or user will get very far with this Pro. ??Too wise, savvy, and alert to be taken by anyone using dating sites for anything but finding true love.The other made obvious red flag. These Clowns either ask for your phone number right off. Or they message their number right away in order to get your phone number. I don’t rush into relationships. It takes time to get know the soul of the person. Anything worth having takes time !All that being stated. All scammers, players and users will be reported and blocked. Whom ever is interested in getting to know me. Let’s begin by getting better acquainted by messaging and if things progress nicely; we would meet for a relaxed lunch or dinner. I do not publicly define everything about me. I rather get to know the person face to face. These scammers I have had to report then block. Only prey on what they read about the single woman and use that to draft their scripts.The more scammers that prey, the more we learn. They reveal themselves so easily. And; Upping your game will not get far with me. ??Guys : Beware. The female scammers are lurking all over these dating sites as well. Thank you for visiting my profile.

Life will always present lemons at various stages. Take the lemons+squeeze+sugar=lemonade. What a delightful outcome...LOVE me some lemonade (smile)!Hmmm...A little about me...The most important thing to know is that I have an incredible relationship with GOD that is intimate, unusual and FUN! Please note I am not about religion but rather RELATIONSHIP. I am balanced, fun-loving yet serious when appropriate, family oriented, educated(college as well as common sense splashed with wisdom:-), affectionate, sensual(this is not synonymous with sexual...smile),passionate and articulate in my methods of communicating. I would also characterize myself as interdependent(used to say independent but growth dictated I change that), motivated, great listener, optomistic, charismatic, romantic and flirtatious...yes flirtatious, but respectfully so (wink).An entrepenuer at heart, I am ambitious and actively pursuing goals but in a relaxed manner that comes with wisdom. I LOVE with a passion what I do. I am dreaming a dream that is SOooo big that without GOD I will surely fail. My dreams have translated into vision and purpose. Any dreamers/visionarians (Is that even a word...oh we'll somebody call Webster's Dictionary, operating in my creative vein...lol) out there???I enjoy a multiplicity of things to include...worship,traveling, museums, bookstores (nerdy huh lol), watching a beautiful sunset, walking the beachside mesmerized by the ripple of waves created by the tide (this would be doubly pleasurable shared with ""The One”, working out, shooting pool, listening to some smooth jazz/r&b(enjoy venues with live bands),enjoying a cup of starbucks (or quality blend of coffee) while writing (one of my passions). I am currently writing my first manuscript that I hope to have completed soon.Although I did indicate in my profile long-term, allow me to clarify. I believe that any viable relationship begins with a friendship first. If there is Christ, chemistry, and compatibility (my 3 c's), it can progress into something more serious/long-term. I am definitely open to/desiring a serious relationship, but that isn't where I begin. I enjoy the JOURNEY of a FABULOUS friendship. A man with a zest for life and capable of effectively communicating his REAL feelings, fears, dreams, etc...is appealing to me. I especially enjoy interacting with individuals who can stimulate my intellect AND take a risk to become vulnerable . Though I have been disappointed in love, I am in no way bitter. I am not afraid of being vulnerable to love when it presents. Yes, I am a hopeless romantic(smile). I look forward to meeting my life-mate(some would refer to as soul-mate).

match_399,Julep,Looking for a new reason to smile...,"['Anime', 'Voice acting', 'Traveling']","Very tall SBF new to Austin, and travels a little bit in my career.. Occasionally I might act a little silly at sometimes but the truth is I am very intelligent, educated (multi Bach. degrees & a Masters). I understand no one is perfect and I will admit to my flaws. I have no issues with my self-esteem (ENFP personality type). I am a BBW- big curvy & tall woman that is well aware of what I look like, and I think I am adorable (& I post updated pics)! My current size is XL, & my gym goal is to work on my muscle development for my curvy frame. I'm active and I like being outdoors, but if you have issues with body types, please bypass me. I'm a faithful and awesome a friend to have, and most seem to think of me as a sister.. I love swimming and working out, so if you know your way around in a gym, definitely hit me up. I'm fun and down to earth, and a cancer survivor who embraces the joy each new day can bring. I believe in being civil; and I'm the type who will follow up in communicating (even if it is to wish you well and part ways). Just here to make friends and hangout for now. I haven't been successful in making friends as a newbie to the area, and so that's my M.O. I'm not hip, nor do I smoke/drink. I tend to be observant of men and more interested in their behaviors . This doesn't mean I am a sexual prude; it means that I know that there is a time and place for everything. Sex is NOT the FIRST thing you should discuss with a stranger, but I can converse on it when I get to know you. I believe in things happening at their own pace. I am a highly passionate person and seek that trait in others. If I'm pleased, I will always make sure those around me are even more so. FYI I am a SCORPIO, if you are into zodiacs.  Although I no longer live in Houston, I still love taking in the city life. I like traveling and going out but I don't get to do this much these days. I recently moved to the Austin area. I'm can really appreciate refined folks in suits & silk, but know I grew up kind of country.  I like interesting, intelligent people who do not hang on to baggage and truely enjoy life. I don't usually have hang-ups about race, gender nor age. Fairly open minded, as long as I feel I am being RESPECTED. I have a soft spot for children & animals, and an unexplainable fascination with redheads (still trying to figure that one out). I'm often described as very friendly easy-going, but I am by no means a push-over...I stand my ground and yet know when to be flexible. I am told I am somewhat unconventional, but I am who I am, and if that is different, so be it. My biggest pet peev is being told a pretty lie vs an uglier truth (respect me enough to give me the option of handling reality). I feel that basic manners to respond to those who write, even if it is to say ""no thank you"". I am learning how to play golf, but I have played rugby. I am a horrid speller and I always have lip gloss nearby. The last time a guy left me speechless, he sung karaoke pitch perfect, in the style of Steve Perry. I'll put care into looking good, but I love to go fishing and ""mudding"". I'm comfortable in jeans and can change my ride's oil. I am a good listener, and I am drawn to shy people as a challenge. I am the loyal friend most say they want but few people have.  I believe in treating people like they want to be treated. I am slow to anger, and I try to give everyone a benefit of a doubt.. If I can be summed up in one word, I think it would be ""KIND"". I could go on and on about myself, but it would not come close to really telling you who I am.WHAT I LIKE IN OTHERS: a good sense of humor, compassion, nice smiles, creativity, honesty, passionate about life, open minded and a competitive spirit. I generally am drawn to people older than myself. Seeing a guy in a well made suit is what dreams are made of, lol. I also have a soft spot for self-declared ""nerds"", ""dorks"" and ""geeks"".

Someone who wants to find a relationship where both people give 100% to maintaining the spark that was there in the beginning. If any of the following interests you, please MESSAGE me. I promise I won’t bite. Aren't you tired of those average girls? They all say, ""I'm looking for someone special, and I like to have fun."" Well you won't find any of those cliché's here. Try out an exceptional woman for once. I'll challenge you. And I want you to challenge me.To give you some insight into my contrariness: - I am successful in my job, but I believe in traditional gender roles.- I am independent, but I yearn for a strong partner to lead me.- I have deeply held beliefs, but I'm always open to listening to opposite arguments.- I'm looking for a fellow sapiophile, but I enjoy silly movies (like Tommy Boy and Elf)I admire a man who is a strong Christian and an old fashioned gentleman. I love to banter, and I have been told I have a quick wit. Try me out, and see if I live up to the hype. I have a big heart and a lot of love to give to the right person. That being said - you will not see that side of me until I feel comfortable and I feel I can trust you with my sensitive heart. On a first meeting you will meet the intelligent, considerate, witty, flirty me. An awesome girl, but you will not see the deeper, more sensitive, seductive, loving me. That is reserved for those who spend some effort getting to know me and take the TIME to do so. I WANT to find love, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my heart to do so. When I make the step to meet someone I look for reasons to say yes and continue the interaction. I will give you every benefit of the doubt, but I have a nose like a bloodhound for BS, and I will call you on it.I'm not perfect, and I don't expect you to be. I do expect you to be a work in progress. I pride myself on always trying to improve. I've made a recommitment to living a healthier lifestyle. I've lost over 50 pounds since November 2016. Slow but steady wins the race. I'm not here to have an online relationship. I like to meet in person as soon as possible. No matter how much chemistry there may be online or over the phone, it is always different in person. The whole point of this endeavor is to have a relationship in REAL LIFE - at least it is for me.

I try to eat a decently “clean” diet. I wish I was a better cook but I almost never use a recipe.I like the occasional video game. I do not play anything with regularity but it is nice to escape into one.In and Outside....I enjoy seeing local live music and going out dancing. This does NOT mean that I am a huge party animal. I am social, outgoing and love the general energy of somewhere that has something to dance to. I also enjoy going to low-key kind of places... some good beer on a random day after work.

No Rescue needed.My kids are grown. I enjoy my job.Time, good conversation & touch are my love languages.  My goal is regular time together, home and out but I also enjoy my separate time. I am self sufficient and happy and seek the same.I appreciate a southern gentleman with manners who hasn’t forgotten the art and value of old school dating and romance. I like confidence, not arrogance. My special someone is a kind man, future grandpa material, not jaded, doesn't turn every discussion into a debate and is able to allow others to have their own opinions about politics and religion. Must understand the difference between affection and clingy and the difference between sexual and sensual. Must be available to date some weeknights and on the weekends.I am a lady, not a lay. If you just want sex please skip me. If you want a mama, skip. Once monogamous I do enjoy sex several times a week if schedules permit. If you have no sex drive skip me. That being said, understand i will not just be slipping into your bed. I want to know you and like you which requires dating. If I am not drawn to you as a person I will not desire you sexually. Appeal to my humor and intellect. I do not send nude pics or explicit details. Please don't ask or send.My profile pretty much spells it out. Looking for that one monogamous relationship that combines romantic dates, time in everyday life, emotional attachments and hot sex. I don't need to marry again but I've learned to never say never. I like my alone time so can feel smothered by someone who latches on to me as an instant life. I have been told that's just because it's not the right man. That when the right one comes along we will feel inseparable and not smothered or tethered. We've all had our own journeys at this point and feel we know what we want next, but the truth is that if that ""just right fit"" fell into our laps all preconceived rules and plans would fly out the window because we couldn't have possibly anticipated such joy and ease. So here I am trolling the pond, again. LOLInitial messaging here is fine for pre-screening and initial chatting but I prefer to meet in person to see if whit, humor, conversation and chemistry click.

Ethnicity is not a barrier... I am very driven, I work hard and have many goals and dreams to accomplish. I am not a procrastinator. When I am ready to go for something, I go for it. This is good and bad. I am often taking on more than most can chew, but I chew it and keep it moving nonetheless. I am very into politics and fighting against social injustice. On paper I am a democrat/liberal however I am more centered. I don't care what party you are, and you can support who you support, however if you live in the Trump bubble and ignore his lack of decency.....morals..... a brain (lol) and pretend like what is happening is not really happening then we will not be a good match. I don't debate, I can have a discussion on realistic things but playing ignorance to reality is not toleratedWhat qualities am I looking for in a man..... Hmmm.... Someone who has an understanding of the 5 Love Languages. If you don't know what that is google it. Someone who knows what their love language is and can communicate it, however, and equally important, a man willing to learn her love language and caters to it. Someone who communicates by listening for discernment and understanding, not a comeback. This is very important..... Someone who does without having being told to do. Someone who is patient, understanding, and can bring a sense of calm to my maddening world..... The art of courtship has been lost and I am patient enough to wait until I find it or it finds me. My time is valuable. Literally every second of my days are accounted for so definitely someone who appreciates and respects my time.So basically, “The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you can find someone to love the you that you love, well, that's just fabulous.”P.S. I do not give out my number on this site.

I still walk fast and talk fast and I love the NY Yankees - I have the Bronx in my blood.

I listen to Tanya Tucker, Steve Earle, Bruce, Willie, Guy, The Dixie Chicks, The Clash, GaGa, Ella, Pearl Jam and everything in between and around. I dream of traveling - road trips, day trips, any old trip even a head trip. It's what makes my heart beat fast and my smile wider. I'm pretty active. I have an active gym membership...meaning I actually go regularly and do stuff! I do a High Intensity Cardio/Weight training class 3/4x a week and I usually find other stuff to do throughout the week. I like to try new stuff. Being active is important to me. I've had my share of injuries...concussions, broken ribs...I fall off my bikes but I still ride 'em, even vacation with them. I like to cook! More than that - I love food shopping- grocery stores-I love them. There is nothing better to me than planning a meal and shopping for it! What can I say? The first time I walked into Central Market was pure JOY for me. Food makes me very happy. That's enough of me. The last thing I'll say for now is that I'm progressive with my politics.

match_92,PrincipessaLisa,Must Love Me,"['Runner', 'Reader', 'Beach']","I love life and am passionate about God, people, art, food, history, health, romance, and children. Mostly, I follow my own rules; breaking new ground and paving my own path; always looking for the opportunity to learn and grow. I don’t follow society or its social demands of each new and passing trend. My friends say my character is impeccable and my integrity is solid but trust me, I am far from perfect. I have many flaws but am committed to becoming all that God created me to be (sounds like an Army commercial LOL) Running is one of my favorite passions. When the day is over, it’s just me and the pavement for the next several miles; leaving the stress of life behind me.I honestly believe that making a difference in someone's life is far more important than any title, salary or degree so I don’t care how many letters come at the end of your signature. Caring and giving to others bring true joy to my soul. My heart is especially drawn to children; abused and neglected and I want to travel the world loving them and feeding them with the word of God. My friends consider me to be creative, very resilient, a survivor and one who views the glass as half full rather than half empty. At times I am impulsive, and I find much excitement in creating romantic spontaneous adventures. I would much rather be outdoors with the warmth of the sun on my face so in my leisure time you can usually find me exploring this wonderful world we live in. On the serious side I am very traditional, loyal, loving, kind, and attentive. I have seen much tragedy tramway and devastation first hand which gives me an appreciation for life and how precious it really is.My relationship with Christ and living each day to honor him is the most important thing in my life. I am only interested in being a life partner (that means marriage), not a temporary position in a man's world. This is the only area that is not flexible for me. My hope and prayer is that the Lord will bless me with the man I desire…. One is uncompromising and compliments my walk with Him. I appreciate romance and chivalry and prefer spending time with an intelligent, refined gentleman who has passion in his eyes, leadership in his walk, and tenderness in his hand. I find myself drawn to gentlemen who are respectful, kind, compassionate, affectionate, and giving from their heart. I am looking forward to spending time with you; exploring this beautiful and marvelous thing we call LIFE.",Non-Smoker with Average body type," Lake travis, Texas ","52 year old Female, 5' 5"" (165cm), Christian - other",Caucasian,PrincipessaLisa wants to find someone to marry.,Graduate Degree,Princess,Real estate Investor/Travel Agent,Man,Long Term,Not Completed,View her chemistry results,Socially,Does not want children,Divorced,No,Brown,Hazel,Yes,All my kids are over 18,Over 10 years,Ambitious,,,Dog,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52,F,Sagittarius
